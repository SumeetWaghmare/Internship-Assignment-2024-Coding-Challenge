"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,"  Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4]  Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7]  In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]    In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11]  In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14]  In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16]  In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17]  In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21]  A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22]  In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24]  In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26]  In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]    On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31]  It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32]  On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34]  On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38]  On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40]  In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.  Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46]  On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48]  In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50]  Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56]  In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59] "

"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players",https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players",https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said.  Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles.  Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result.  Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.”  After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high. "

Second Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Second Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook Based upon our current projections, Canoo expects: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, August 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Los""s is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.   NON GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE (in thousands)   These non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA AdjustedNet Loss Net loss $    (70,870) $      (70,870) $     (70,870) $  (164,392) $ (164,392) $    (164,392) Interest expense (income) 2,264 2,264 — (19) (19) — Provision for income taxes — — — — — — Depreciation 4,562 4,562 — 2,892 2,892 — Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability — (59) (59) — (9,471) (9,471) Gain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability — (5,623) (5,623) — — — Loss on extinguishment of debt — 949 949 — — — Other income (expense), net — (226) (226) — 378 378 Stock-based compensation — 6,707 6,707 — 20,773 20,773 Adjusted Non-GAAP amount (64,044) (62,296) (69,122) (161,519) (149,839) (152,712) US GAAP net loss per share Basic N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.68) Diluted N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.68) Adjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS): Basic N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.63) Diluted N/A N/A (0.14) N/A N/A (0.63) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic N/A N/A 505,576 N/A N/A 242,772 Diluted N/A N/A 505,576 N/A N/A 242,772 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 EBITDA AdjustedEBITDA Adjusted Net Loss EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss Net loss $  (161,602) $    (161,602) $   (161,602) $  (289,757) $ (289,757) $    (289,757) Interest expense (income) 2,560 2,560 — 9 9 — Provision for income taxes — — — — — — Depreciation 9,137 9,137 — 5,570 5,570 — Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability — (2,564) (2,564) — (24,936) (24,936) Gain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability — (22,965) (22,965) — — — Loss on extinguishment of debt — 27,688 27,688 — — — Other income (expense), net — 1,790 1,790 — 395 395 Stock-based compensation — 16,543 16,543 — 41,453 41,453 Adjusted Non-GAAP amount (149,905) (129,413) (141,110) (284,178) (267,266) (272,845) US GAAP net loss per share Basic N/A N/A (0.35) N/A N/A (1.22) Diluted N/A N/A (0.35) N/A N/A (1.22) Adjusted Non-GAAP net loss per share (Adjusted EPS): Basic N/A N/A (0.31) N/A N/A (1.15) Diluted N/A N/A (0.31) N/A N/A (1.15) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic N/A N/A 462,303 N/A N/A $     238,242 Diluted N/A N/A 462,303 N/A N/A $     238,242   Forward-Looking Statements  The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts",https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue.  Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year.  On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans.  “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.”  “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career.   Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported.  As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers.  Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.  This is the web version of CFO Daily, a newsletter on the trends and individuals shaping corporate finance.

"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428915-canoo-changes-in-business-change-our-view,"Photo by 3alexd/E+ via Getty Images In a previous article we argued that electric-vehicle maker Canoo's (NASDAQ:GOEV) differentiated technology and go-to-market model would position it favorably in the EV space. The company came public last December following a SPAC merger. On March 29, they released their first financial quarterly report, and it is fair to say that investors weren't happy with the updates that management gave. The company announced a fundamental shift in its go-to-market strategy, away from contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and away from its subscription-model towards focusing on commercial EV opportunities. Shares of Canoo were hit hard after the report, and are down about 65% from the $20 highs we saw back in Jan/Feb, while the company's market cap shrunk to only $1.75bn as of this writing, one of the lowest from a basket of EV upstarts. Data by YCharts When Canoo announced in August 2020 to go public via SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition IV, management laid out an aggressive go-to-market strategy that built on two key pillars: one was the licensing and contract engineering on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology, and secondly, the company also planned to sell its different EV-types (including a lifestyle and a multi-purpose delivery vehicle) directly to consumers via a monthly subscription (B2C). For their delivery vehicle the company aims at directly selling them to business in a B2B approach. The focus on these pillars was strongly presented in its SPAC presentation (see some excerpts below): Source: Company presentation The company also put significant focus on the commercial relevance of its contract manufacturing & engineering capabilities, on the basis of its proprietary skateboard technology.  Source: Company presentation Both business segments would use the underlying multi-purpose skateboard technology which essentially is a flat, drivable rolling chassis that contains the electrical architecture necessary for EVs. The beauty of the manufacturing approach on the basis of the skateboard is that the vehicle body just needs to be assembled on top of the skateboard, a so-called ""top hat design"" approach, which is expected to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce cost and time to market. According to management the skateboard technology would be the first true steer-by-wire solution that would come to market, which would be an important differentiator from competitor offerings.  It needs to be mentioned here that also other EV manufacturers are working on similar technology concepts, including REE Automotive, which is going public through a SPAC with 10x Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC), and private-company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Canoo was planning to contract these manufacturing capabilities to other car manufacturers. Furthermore, management also pivoted towards selling its in-house developed cars via a potentially revolutionary approach, by offering a subscription plan that management claimed would be significantly different from a traditional lease and cost-efficient compared to an ownership model. And the company's plans should not stop here. Management also intended to sell its multi-purpose delivery vehicle in a B2B approach to capture share in the last-mile delivery market, while arguing that the delivery vehicle would offer best-in-class total cost of ownership, cargo volume (30% more parcel volume vs. current options), and functionally-designed features, compared to current delivery-vehicle solutions, possibly enabling up to $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles (Source). The refreshing approach and multiple revenue streams that Canoo's management presented to investors, and the pivot away from the car industry's regular business model definitely drove some of the optimism and hype towards the company. While these were all nice promises, high hopes got crushed when the company announced its first results as a public company. When Canoo announced its first earnings report as a public company on March 29th, the first surprise for many investors was that the company announced key changes to its leadership team. It was announced that Chief financial officer Paul Balciunas would leave the company. Canoo also announced on April 22nd that Tony Aquila will also take on the role of Chief Executive Officer replacing former CEO Ulrich Kranz, who has resigned effective April 30, 2021. While it is not clear as to why former CEO Ulrich Kranz resigned, it gives some bitter taste to the story and we definitely don't like the high leadership turnover. But these were not the only announcements that put pressure on Canoo's stock. The company announced a number of changes, including that it would no longer pursue the contract engineering part of its business. The reason was that the company wants to protect its intellectual property which it seemingly would not be able to do by licensing it to other manufacturers. On the conference call, analyst Craig Irwin asked about the conflicting statements that management gave:   Craig Irwin: Okay. The second question there - there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was - it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license. Tony Aquila: Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started - I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value. While the answer from Tony Aquila eluded to potential IP leakage and the concerns management had that this approach would not be driving the best shareholder value, we are not very happy with the contradictory explanation. This is especially concerning in light of the fact that Canoo initially planned to generate revenue from the contract manufacturing segment of >$500 million by 2025, with a CAGR of 39% between 2021 and 2025 (see our calculation here). It's dubious to us why management now suddenly makes a U-turn when the management team should not have provided such bloated numbers leading to its SPAC deal just to give potential investors false promises on what many investors saw as a key differentiator vs. competition. The announced change on the contract engineering front also undermines all hopes from Canoo's earlier announced partnership with Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) while it also puts to rest any hopes for a potential deal with Apple (AAPL). Again, management didn't give a clear answer to questions on their plans during the conference call when asked by analysts:   Joseph Spak: Okay. Well, last one for me, just going back to the decision to deemphasize engineering with the Hyundai arrangement the original one, which I'm assuming that that's now off the table. But if you go back to that release, did say Hyundai gains access to technology, you mentioned IP leakage is one of the potential problems with that arrangement. Can you just talk about, like how do you unwind that sort of memorandum of understanding what work was done? Do you think there was any IP leakage obviously Hyundai is coming out with their own electric vehicle platforms as well? Tony Aquila I think what happened is pretty kind of case in point. So I think the company, just like any adolescent companies, it's learning its way and all of us go through it. But it factored in contract manufacturing based on the labor of engineers, not based on the value of IP, which would have changed the value of that contract significantly. And look, we have experience in this area and we're very focused on if we do work, one, we can protect our IP and we can get the residual value of that in addition to. So it's kind of caused us to say, hey, let's put that on hold. We have so much demand for our three derivatives. Let's get all that work done. And then let's, look at if there is partnerships, partnerships can work in this industry. But contract manufacturing work is as you know is not the best business line to be in. The announced changes in Canoo's strategy don't stop here as management also mentioned that the previously announced subscription model for its direct-to-consumer offerings (lifestyle and sports vehicle) will now only be optional, and are expected to only account for a small part of its revenue going forward, especially since the consumer business will be de-emphasized in favor of commercial opportunities. This is a significant strategy shift as the company initially forecasted subscription revenue to reach almost $2 billion by 2026 (see forecast below). So again, why did management not get to the realization earlier that this would not be the most promising path?  Source: company presentation With all these changes, Canoo is now a fundamentally changed story and a perfect example of why investors should be cautious to believe in pre-SPAC projections. We have made a similar mistake by putting too much trust into management's projections. While we always took a very careful stance at the company's projections, the significant U-turn lead is to sell our shares over the past weeks. Wall Street seems to agree that the fundamental changes in Canoo's business model create many uncertainties to say the least: The recently announced changes imply a fundamental shift in the business and go-to-market strategy. While the core technology of Canoo's multi-purpose platform did not change, it remains a big question mark how the company will use this technology to generate revenue besides in-house manufacturing when they are shying away from building up a contract engineering business. Canoo remains only one very small player amongst many upstarts within the highly competitive EV industry. So deemphasizing potential revenue-generating partnerships will not only create a cash-problem going forward, but will also take off some of the buzz that was generated around the Hyundai, as well as the potential Apple partnership. The recent strategy changes create a high level of uncertainty as to how the company will finally be able to generate revenue. Canoo's business model is currently no more refined or differentiated than it was at its inception. In fact, it appears that management is not sure themselves what the best route to commercialization is. While several of the announced changes could be regarded as logical, i.e. the pivot towards commercial opportunities, the changes introduce further risk around the company's ability to execute. While it's probably worth asking as to how much the initial story really changed it is a fact that two main pillars of the company's initial forecast, i.e. contract engineering and car-subscriptions, which together accounted for a combined total of around $2.5bn in revenue until 2026, will simply be eliminated from the forecast. Since so much has changed and the path to revenue generation is increasingly unclear, we are distancing ourselves from Canoo stock for the foreseeable future. But Canoo's management may still prove their critics wrong with what's left of the company: an intriguing underlying technology and a market cap that is below the initial SPAC valuation and significantly smaller compared to many of its high-flying peers. However, this is simply too much of a gamble for us. So we will be staying on the sidelines on Canoo stock after selling all our shares over the past weeks.

Download Now First, you‘ll need to figure out who you’re competing with to compare the data accurately. What works in a business like yours may not work for your brand. So how can you do this? Divide your “competitors” into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct competitors are businesses that offer a product or service that could pass as a similar substitute for yours and that operate in your same geographic area. On the flip side, an indirect competitor provides products that are not the same but could satisfy the same customer need or solve the same problem. It seems simple enough on paper, but these two terms are often misused. When comparing your brand, you should only focus on your direct competitors. This is something many brands get wrong. Let's use an example: Stitch Fix and Fabletics are both subscription-based services that sell clothes on a monthly basis and serve a similar target audience. But as we look deeper, we can see that the actual product (clothes in this case) is not the same; one brand focuses on stylish everyday outfits while the other is workout-centric attire only. Yes, these brands satisfy the same need for women (having trendy clothes delivered right to their doorstep each month), but they do so with completely different types of clothing, making them indirect competitors. This means Kate Hudson‘s team at Fabletics would not want to spend their time studying Stitch Fix too closely since their audiences probably vary quite a bit. Even if it’s only slightly, this tiny variation is enough to make a big difference. Now, this doesn't mean you should toss your indirect competitors out the window completely. Keep these brands on your radar since they could shift positions at any time and cross over into the direct competitor zone. Using our example, Stitch Fix could start a workout line, which would certainly change things for Fabletics. This is also one of the reasons why you‘ll want to routinely run a competitor analysis. The market can and will shift at any time, and if you’re not constantly scoping it out, you won‘t be aware of these changes until it’s too late.

At the heart of any business is its product or service, which is what makes this a good place to start. You‘ll want to analyze your competitor’s complete product line and the quality of the products or services they're offering. You should also take note of their pricing and any discounts they're offering customers. Some questions to consider include: Running a sales analysis of your competitors can be a bit tricky. You'll want to track down the answers to questions such as: These helpful pieces of information will give you an idea of how competitive the sales process is and what information you need to prepare your sales reps with to compete during the final buy stage. For publicly held companies, you can find annual reports online, but you'll have to do some sleuthing to find this info from privately owned businesses. You could find some of this information by searching through your CRM and reaching out to those customers who mentioned they were considering your competitor. Find out what made them choose your product or service over others out there. To do this, run a report that shows all prospective deals where there was an identified competitor. If this data is not something you currently record, talk to marketing and sales to implement a system where prospects are questioned about the other companies they are considering. Essentially, they‘ll need to ask their leads (either through a form field or during a one-on-one sales conversation) to identify who their current service providers are, who they’ve used in the past, and who else they are considering during the buying process. When a competitor is identified, have your sales team dive deeper by asking why they are considering switching to your product. If you've already lost the deal, be sure to follow up with the prospect to determine why you lost to your competitor. What services or features attracted the prospect? Was it about price? What‘s the prospect’s impression of your sales process? If they've already made the switch, find out why they made this decision. By asking open-ended questions, you'll have honest feedback about what customers find appealing about your brand and what might be turning customers away. Once you‘ve answered these questions, you can start scoping out your competitor’s marketing efforts. There are a few major factors that go into correctly pricing your product — and one major one is understanding how much your competitors are charging for a similar product or service. If you feel your product offers superior features compared to those of a competitor, you might consider making your product or service more expensive than industry standards. However, if you do that, you'll want to ensure your sales reps are ready to explain why your product is worth the additional cost. Alternatively, perhaps you feel there‘s a gap in your industry for affordable products. If that’s the case, you might aim to charge less than competitors and appeal to prospects who aren't looking to break the bank for a high-quality product. Of course, other factors go into correctly pricing a product, but it‘s critical you stay on top of industry pricing to ensure you’re pricing your product in a way that feels reasonable to prospects. Additionally, take a look at any perks your competitors offer and how you might match those perks to compete. For instance, perhaps your competitors offer a major referral discount or a month-long free trial version. These perks could be the reason you‘re losing customers, so if it feels reasonable for your brand, consider where you might match those perks — or provide some unique perks of your own if competitors don’t offer any. Did you know expensive shipping is the number one reason for cart abandonment? Nowadays, free shipping is a major perk that can attract consumers to choose one brand over another. If you work in an industry where shipping is a major factor — like e-commerce — you‘ll want to take a look at competitors’ shipping costs and ensure you're meeting (if not exceeding) those prices. If most of your competitors offer free shipping, you‘ll want to look into the option for your own company. If free shipping isn’t a practical option for your business, consider how you might differentiate in other ways — including loyalty programs, holiday discounts, or giveaways on social media.

Analyzing your competitor's website is the fastest way to gauge their marketing efforts. Take note of any of the following items and copy down the specific URL for future reference: Then, take a look at the quantity of these items. Do they have several hundred blog posts or a small handful? Are there five white papers and just one e-book? Next, determine the frequency of these content assets. Are they publishing something new each week or once a month? How often does a new e-book or case study come out? Chances are, if you come across a robust archive of content, your competitor has been publishing regularly. Depending on the topics they're discussing, this content may help you hone in on their lead-generating strategies. From there, you should move on to evaluating the quality of their content. After all, if the quality is lacking, it won‘t matter how often they post since their target audience won’t find much value in it. Choose a small handful of samples to review instead of tackling every single piece to make the process more manageable. Your sampler should include content pieces covering a variety of topics, so you'll have a fairly complete picture of what your competitor shares with their target audience. When analyzing your competitor's content, consider the following questions: As you continue to scan the content, pay attention to the photos and imagery your competitors are using. Do you quickly scroll past generic stock photos, or are you impressed by custom illustrations and images? If they're using stock photos, do they at least have overlays of text quotes or calls-to-action that are specific to their business? If their photos are custom, are they sourced from outside graphic professionals, or do they appear to be done in-house? When you have a solid understanding of your competitor‘s content marketing strategy, it’s time to find out if it's truly working for them. Understanding what types of technology your competitors use can be critical for helping your own company reduce friction and increase momentum within your organization. For instance, perhaps you‘ve seen positive reviews about a competitor’s customer service — as you're conducting research, you learn the customer uses powerful customer service software you haven't been taking advantage of. This information should arm you with the opportunity to outperform your competitors' processes. To figure out which software your competitors use, type the company's URL into Built With, an effective tool for unveiling what technology your competitors' site runs on, along with third-party plugins ranging from analytics systems to CRMs. Alternatively, you might consider looking at competitors' job listings, particularly for engineer or web developer roles. The job listing will likely mention which tools a candidate needs to be familiar with — a creative way to gain intel into the technology your competitors use. To gauge how engaging your competitor‘s content is to their readers, you’ll need to see how their target audience responds to what they're posting. Check the average number of comments, shares, and likes on your competitor's content and find out if: From engagement, you‘ll move right along to your competitor’s content promotion strategy. The following questions can also help you prioritize and focus on what to pay attention to: The last area you‘ll want to evaluate when it comes to marketing is your competitor’s social media presence and engagement rates. How does your competition drive engagement with their brand through social media? Do you see social sharing buttons with each article? Does your competitor have links to their social media channels in the header, footer, or somewhere else? Are these clearly visible? Do they use calls-to-action with these buttons? If your competitors are using a social network that you may not be on, it's worth learning more about how that platform may be able to help your business, too. To determine if a new social media platform is worth your time, check your competitor's engagement rates on those sites. First, visit the following sites to see if your competition has an account on these platforms: Then, take note of the following quantitative items from each platform: With the same critical eye you used to gauge your competition's content marketing strategy, take a fine-toothed comb to analyze their social media strategy. What kind of content are they posting? Are they more focused on driving people to landing pages, resulting in new leads? Or are they posting visual content to promote engagement and brand awareness? How much of this content is original? Do they share curated content from other sources? Are these sources regular contributors? What is the overall tone of the content? How does your competition interact with its followers? How frequently do their followers interact with their content? After you collect this data, generate an overall grade for the quality of your competitor's content. This will help you compare the rest of your competitors using a similar grading scale. As you evaluate each component in your competitor analysis (business, sales, and marketing), get into the habit of performing a simplified SWOT analysis at the same time. This means you‘ll take note of your competitor’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats any time you assess an overall grade. Some questions to get you started include: You‘ll be able to compare their weaknesses against your strengths and vice versa. By doing this, you can better position your company, and you’ll start to uncover areas for improvement within your own brand.

Product analysis drills down to discover key differences and similarities in products that share the same general market. If you have a competitor selling products in a similar market niche to your own — you want to ensure that you aren’t losing market share to the competition. Leveraging the example above, we can drill down and discover some of the key differentiators in product offerings.  The first step in any product analysis is to assess current pricing. Nintendo offers three models of its Switch console: The smaller lite version is priced at $199, the standard version is $299, and the new OLED version is $349. Sony, meanwhile, offers two versions of its PlayStation 5 console: The standard edition costs $499, and the digital version, which doesn’t include a disc drive, is $399. Next is a comparison of key features. In the case of our console example, this means comparing features like processing power, memory, and hard drive space. Feature PS5 Standard Nintendo Switch Hard drive space 825 GB 32 GB RAM 16 GB 4 GB USB ports 4 ports 1 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0 Ethernet connection Gigabit None With basic features compared, it’s time to dive deeper with differentiators. While a glance at the chart above seems to indicate that the PS5 is outperforming its competition, this data only tells part of the story. Here’s why: The big selling point of the standard and OLED Switch models is that they can be played as either handheld consoles or docked with a base station connected to a TV. What’s more, this “switching” happens seamlessly, allowing players to play whenever, wherever. The Playstation offering, meanwhile, has leaned into market-exclusive games that are only available on its system to help differentiate them from their competitors. Step 4: Identify market gaps The last step in a competitive product analysis is looking for gaps in the market that could help your company get ahead. When it comes to the console market, one potential opportunity gaining traction is the delivery of games via cloud-based services rather than physical hardware. Companies like Nvidia and Google have already made inroads in this space, and if they can overcome issues with bandwidth and latency, it could change the market at scale. How do you stack up against the competition? Where are you similar, and what sets you apart? This is the goal of competitive analysis. By understanding where your brand and competitors overlap and diverge, you’re better positioned to make strategic decisions that can help grow your brand. Of course, it’s one thing to understand the benefits of competitive analysis, and it’s another to actually carry out an analysis that yields actionable results. Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered with a quick example. Let’s take a look at popular gaming system companies Sony and Nintendo. Sony’s newest offering — the Playstation 5 — recently hit the market but has been plagued by supply shortages. Nintendo’s Switch console, meanwhile, has been around for several years but remains a consistent seller, especially among teens and children. This scenario is familiar for many companies on both sides of the coin; some have introduced new products designed to compete with established market leaders, while others are looking to ensure that reliable sales don’t fall. Using some of the steps listed above, here’s a quick competitive analysis example. In our example, it’s Sony vs Nintendo, but it’s also worth considering Microsoft’s Xbox, which occupies the same general market vertical. This is critical for effective analysis; even if you’re focused on specific competitors and how they compare, it’s worth considering other similar market offerings. PlayStation offers two PS5 versions, digital and standard, at different price points, while Nintendo offers three versions of its console. Both companies also sell peripherals — for example, Sony sells virtual reality (VR) add-ons, while Nintendo sells gaming peripherals such as steering wheels, tennis rackets, and differing controller configurations. When it comes to sales tactics and marketing, Sony and Nintendo have very different approaches. In part thanks to the recent semiconductor shortage, Sony has driven up demand via scarcity — very low volumes of PS5 consoles remain available. Nintendo, meanwhile, has adopted a broader approach by targeting families as its primary customer base. This effort is bolstered by the Switch Lite product line, which is smaller and less expensive, making it a popular choice for children. The numbers tell the tale: Through September 2021, Nintendo sold 14.3 million consoles, while Sony sold 7.8 million. Sony has the higher price point: Their standard PS5 sells for $499, while Nintendo’s most expensive offering comes in at $349. Both offer robust digital marketplaces and the ability to easily download new games or services. Here, the key differentiators are flexibility and fidelity. The Switch is flexible — users can dock it with their television and play it like a standard console or pick it up and take it anywhere as a handheld gaming system. The PS5, meanwhile, has superior graphics hardware and processing power for gamers who want the highest-fidelity experience. If you compare the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Sony, the difference is immediately apparent: Sony’s ads feature realistic in-game footage and speak to the exclusive nature of their game titles. The company has managed to secure deals with several high-profile game developers for exclusive access to new and existing IPs. Nintendo, meanwhile, uses brightly lit ads showing happy families playing together or children using their smaller Switches while traveling. Engagement helps drive sales and encourage repeat purchases. While there are several ways to measure engagement, social media is one of the most straightforward: In general, more followers equates to more engagement and greater market impact. When it comes to our example, Sony enjoys a significant lead over Nintendo: While the official Playstation Facebook page has 38 million followers, Nintendo has just 5 million. Competitive analysis is complex, especially when you’re assessing multiple companies and products simultaneously. To help streamline the process, we’ve created 10 free templates that make it possible to see how you stack up against the competition — and what you can do to increase market share. Let’s break down our SWOT analysis template. Here’s what it looks like:  Download Free Templates Strengths. Identify your strengths. These may include specific pieces of intellectual property, products that are unique to the market, or a workforce that outperforms the competition. Weaknesses. Here, it’s worth considering potential issues around pricing, leadership, staff turnover, and new competitors in the market. Opportunities. This part of the SWOT analysis can focus on new market niches, evolving consumer preferences, or new technologies being developed by your company. Threats. These might include new taxes or regulations on existing products or an increasing number of similar products in the same market space that could negatively affect your overall share. A competitive analysis framework is a structured approach used to evaluate potential competitors and understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This framework serves as a guide for businesses to identify competitive advantages, understand market positioning, and inform strategic decisions. Depending on the industry and the company's objectives, this framework might focus on areas like product features, market share, pricing, customer feedback, and more. Conducting a thorough competitive analysis involves several steps: The five key components of a competitive analysis include: The 3 C's refer to a strategic model that considers three main factors when understanding the broader business environment: Yes, SWOT analysis is a type of competitive analysis. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze these four elements of a business. While a SWOT analysis can be focused internally on a company‘s own attributes, when used as a competitive analysis tool, it assesses a competitor’s SWOT to understand where your business has advantages or might be vulnerable. Before you accurately compare your competition, you need to establish a baseline. This also helps when it comes time to perform a SWOT analysis. Take an objective look at your business, sales, and marketing reports through the same metrics you use to evaluate your competition. Record this information just like you would with a competitor and use this as your baseline to compare across the board.

"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts",https://www.coursera.org/articles/competitor-analysis,"Discover what goes into competitor analysis, how it benefits your business, and the steps to conducting a competitor analysis.  A competitor analysis, also called competitive analysis and competition analysis, is the process of examining similar brands in your industry to gain insight into their offerings, branding, sales, and marketing approaches. Knowing your competitors in business analysis is important if you’re a business owner, marketer, start-up founder, or product developer.  A competitor analysis offers several benefits, including:   Understanding industry standards so that you can meet and exceed them    Discovering untapped niche markets   Differentiating products and services Fulfilling customers’ desires and solving their problems better than competitors Distinguishing your brand Standing out in your marketing  Measuring your growth  The sections below provide a competitor analysis framework for evaluating your industry’s competitive landscape. Return to this framework regularly and apply the insights to develop your business. Start by reviewing your own business values, goals, branding, products, and services. That way, you can easily identify existing brands that target customers might choose over yours.   Next, turn to Google. Type in your product name or category. What brands and companies come up when you search ""hydrating lipstick"", for example? What comes up when you search social media channels for relevant hashtags or keywords? Using the information you gathered, make a list of up to 10 brands whose offerings most resemble yours and present your target customers with comparable alternatives. Identify potential direct competitors (those who sell a similar product to a similar audience) and indirect competitors (those who sell a different product to a similar audience).  By examining how competitors structure their businesses, you can gauge how equipped they are to grow, gain market share, and earn customer loyalty in your target market. Review each competitor’s website and social media profile to gather the following information:    How large is the company, in terms of the number of leaders and employees? How many years has the company been in operation?  What job openings do these companies list on Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn? What are their areas of expansion? For publicly traded companies, you may be able to review their annual reports and gain insight into how much revenue they’re generating, their debt and liability, and other performance metrics.    A value proposition is a short statement that summarizes the benefits of a product and why a customer would choose it over competing products. A value proposition often looks something like the following: We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service].    In this section, you will understand competitors’ value propositions in order to ensure your product or service stands out in the marketplace. Review major competitors’ site copy, particularly on the ""About"" or What We Do"" pages, as well as analyzing any blogs and stories on their website. Answer these questions for each competitor:    What problems and pain points do competitors’ products solve?  What desires do the products fulfill?  What benefits or outcomes does the product deliver for customers? What data do they cite to support their claims about products’ benefits? What pricing structure do competitors use?       Evaluate how competitors position themselves in the marketplace. This will allow you to create a marketing strategy that gets your brand in front of your target audience.    For each competitor, answer these questions:   What social media influencers does this company partner with to leverage their authority, authentic content, and personal connections to target customers?    What affiliate marketing or brand ambassador programs does this company offer to leverage the recommendations of satisfied customers?   What kind of digital or traditional paid advertising presence does this company have? On what marketing channels do competitors publish organic content, including websites, landing pages, social media platforms, and email?   What type of content do you see, including articles, videos, ebooks, reports, commercials, and digital ads?   Read more: Marketing Strategy: What It Is and How to Create One Get to know your competitors by auditing their brand identities and getting a sense of why customers might feel connected (and loyal) to that brand.   For each competitor, answers these questions:    If this company were a person, how would you describe its personality?  What words, phrases, tone, and style does this company use in its messaging?   What values do competitors communicate through their messaging?  How would you describe the visual elements of this company’s branding? And how do those elements correspond to the brand’s values, voice, and personality?  What emotions do the brand elements evoke in customers?   Read more: What Is a Brand Strategy? And How to Create One  Study the customer journeys that your competitors have set up to nurture and convert customers. Your goal is to gauge how seamless, integrated, and logical it is to go from the first touchpoint to making a purchase and beyond.      Start by following your competitors on social media, subscribing to them via email, and purchasing products and services to experience each customer journey for yourself.    As you experience the customer journey for each competitor, gather information on the following:    What are the different touchpoints along this company’s customer journey? What elements make it easy to keep moving along the customer journey?  What calls to action and instructions are there to make it clear how to proceed? What kinds of content educate and entertain you at each touchpoint? What elements create friction or make it difficult to advance to the next step? What do you experience after subscribing or making a purchase? Do you find customer support, upsells, and access to a community?  In this step, you will scour competitors’ customer reviews, reactions, and comments on their social media posts, social media mentions, media appearances, and even employee reviews on job sites to understand the perception of competitors in the marketplace. With this information, you can strategize how to garner a positive reputation for your brand, learn from competitors’ mistakes and challenges, and work to avoid any pitfalls yourself.    For each competitor, explore the following:   How do followers and subscribers interact with this company’s public content? What is the general public sentiment regarding this company, based on mentions, product reviews, and social media likes and comments? Include praise as well as complaints.  What experiences do employees have, based on reviews on job sites like Glassdoor and Indeed?    Share of voice measures how much of the market your brand owns compared to competitors. By determining the share of voice, you can gauge how visible, authoritative, and popular your brand is in the marketplace.  A SWOT analysis is a classic exercise for identifying the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that exist within the competitive landscape. Conduct a SWOT analysis of your competitors to consolidate everything you’ve learned into a succinct story.   What strengths do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What weaknesses do you see in competitors’ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What opportunities do you see for your business to capitalize on? What is your competition doing that might pose a threat to your business?  You can also list the strengths and weaknesses of your business as it currently stands and compare them side-by-side with those of competitors.      For more on SWOT analysis, watch this video from the Business Strategy Specialization:   Once you’ve conducted a competitor analysis, your next step is to apply the insights to your business. Use the following prompts to differentiate your brand, products, and services from competitors and gain market share:   What product features can you add that differentiate your product from competitors? What pricing strategy can you use to attract new customers to your offerings? What design features can you add to your brand to make it stand out? How can you compose a value proposition that stands out from competitors? We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service].   How can you design a more seamless, frictionless customer journey that leads consumers to make a purchase and become loyal brand ambassadors?  How can you create content that improves on that of your competitors, including covering new topics, addressing ignored pain points, recommending new solutions, and offering more exciting experiences?   How can you improve your social media strategy to reach new potential customers? What approaches can you take on marketing channels where your competitors have a presence to distinguish your messaging and present your offerings as the best choice? On which marketing channels do your competitors not (yet) have a presence? What steps can you take to establish and grow a presence on those channels?  Remember that conducting a competitor analysis is a crucial step in developing your business. It can help you differentiate your brand and present your products and services as the best on the market. Return to your competitor analysis efforts regularly, such as every quarter, six months, or year, to account for shifts in competitors’ tactics and new competitors that arrive on the scene. Always look for ways to give your brand and products a competitive edge.  Keep learning about marketing and its role in business with the top-rated courses and Professional Certificates on Coursera:  Stay on top of your industry’s evolution by enrolling in the University of Virginia's Business Strategy Specialization.

"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts",https://asana.com/resources/competitive-analysis-example,"Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. In this guide, we’ll outline how to do a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. Whether you’re running a business or playing in a football game, understanding your competition is crucial for success. While you may not be scoring touchdowns in the office, your goal is to score business deals with clients or win customers with your products. The method of preparation for athletes and business owners is similar—once you understand your strengths and weaknesses versus your competitors’, you can level up.  In this guide, we’ll outline the steps for a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. With our free competitor analysis template, you can identify who you’re up against and create a more insightful business plan. Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own.  Direct competitors market the same product to the same audience as you, while indirect competitors market the same product to a different audience. After identifying your competitors, you can use the information you gather to see where you stand in the market landscape.  The purpose of this type of analysis is to get a competitive advantage in the market and improve your business strategy. Without a competitive analysis, it’s difficult to know what others are doing to win clients or customers in your target market. A competitive analysis report may include: A description of your company’s target market Details about your product or service versus the competitors’ Current and projected market share, sales, and revenues Pricing comparison Marketing and social media strategy analysis Differences in customer ratings You’ll compare each detail of your product or service versus the competition to assess strategy efficacy. By comparing success metrics across companies, you can make data-driven decisions. Follow these five steps to create your competitive analysis report and get a broad view of where you fit in the market. This process can help you analyze a handful of competitors at one time and better approach your target customers. In step one, select between five and 10 competitors to compare against your company. The competitors you choose should have similar product or service offerings and a similar business model to you. You should also choose a mix of both direct and indirect competitors so you can see how new markets might affect your company. Choosing both startup and seasoned competitors will further diversify your analysis. Tip: To find competitors in your industry, use Google or Amazon to search for your product or service. The top results that emerge are likely your competitors. If you’re a startup or you serve a niche market, you may need to dive deeper into the rankings to find your direct competitors. Once you know the competitors you want to analyze, you’ll begin in-depth market research. This will be a mixture of primary and secondary research. Primary research comes directly from customers or the product itself, while secondary research is information that’s already compiled. Then, keep track of the data you collect in a user research template. Primary market research may include:  Purchasing competitors’ products or services Interviewing customers Conducting online surveys of customers  Holding in-person focus groups Secondary market research may include: Examining competitors’ websites Assessing the current economic situation Identifying technological developments  Reading company records Tip: Search engine analysis tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can help you examine competitors’ websites and obtain crucial SEO information such as the keywords they’re targeting, the number of backlinks they have, and the overall health of their website.  The next step in your analysis involves a comparison of your product to your competitors’ products. This comparison should break down the products feature by feature. While every product has its own unique features, most products will likely include: Price Service offered Age of audience served Number of features Style and design Ease of use Type and number of warranties Customer support offered Product quality Tip: If your features table gets too long, abbreviate this step by listing the features you believe are of most importance to your analysis. Important features may include cost, product benefits, and ease of use. The next step in your analysis will look similar to the one before, except you’ll compare the marketing efforts of your competitors instead of the product features. Unlike the product features matrix you created, you’ll need to go deeper to unveil each company’s marketing plan.  Areas you’ll want to analyze include: Social media Website copy Paid ads Press releases Product copy As you analyze the above, ask questions to dig deeper into each company’s marketing strategies. The questions you should ask will vary by industry, but may include: What story are they trying to tell? What value do they bring to their customers? What’s their company mission? What’s their brand voice? Tip: You can identify your competitors’ target demographic in this step by referencing their customer base, either from their website or from testimonials. This information can help you build customer personas. When you can picture who your competitor actively targets, you can better understand their marketing tactics.  Competitive intelligence will make up a significant part of your competitor analysis framework, but once you’ve gathered your information, you can turn the focus back to your company. A SWOT analysis helps you identify your company’s strengths and weaknesses. It also helps turn weaknesses into opportunities and assess threats you face based on your competition. During a SWOT analysis, ask yourself: What do we do well? What could we improve? Are there market gaps in our services? What new market trends are on the horizon? Tip: Your research from the previous steps in the competitive analysis will help you answer these questions and fill in your SWOT analysis. You can visually present your findings in a SWOT matrix, which is a four-box chart divided by category. The last step in your competitive analysis is to understand where you stand in the market landscape. To do this, you’ll create a graph with an X and Y axis. The two axes should represent the most important factors for being competitive in your market.  For example, the X-axis may represent customer satisfaction, while the Y-axis may represent presence in the market. You’ll then plot each competitor on the graph according to their (x,y) coordinates. You’ll also plot your company on this chart, which will give you an idea of where you stand in relation to your competitors.  This graph is included for informational purposes and does not represent Asana’s market landscape or any specific industry’s market landscape.  Tip: In this example, you’ll see three companies that have a greater market presence and greater customer satisfaction than yours, while two companies have a similar market presence but higher customer satisfaction. This data should jumpstart the problem-solving process because you now know which competitors are the biggest threats and you can see where you fall short.  Imagine you work at a marketing startup that provides SEO for dentists, which is a niche industry and only has a few competitors. You decide to conduct a market analysis for your business. To do so, you would: Step 1: Use Google to compile a list of your competitors.  Steps 2, 3, and 4: Use your competitors’ websites, as well as SEO analysis tools like Ahrefs, to deep-dive into the service offerings and marketing strategies of each company.  Step 5: Focusing back on your own company, you conduct a SWOT analysis to assess your own strategic goals and get a visual of your strengths and weaknesses.  Step 6: Finally, you create a graph of the market landscape and conclude that there are two companies beating your company in customer satisfaction and market presence.  After compiling this information into a table like the one below, you consider a unique strategy. To beat out your competitors, you can use localization. Instead of marketing to dentists nationwide like your competitors are doing, you decide to focus your marketing strategy on one region, state, or city. Once you’ve become the known SEO company for dentists in that city, you’ll branch out.  You won’t know what conclusions you can draw from your competitive analysis until you do the work and see the results. Whether you decide on a new pricing strategy, a way to level up your marketing, or a revamp of your product, understanding your competition can provide significant insight. There are some drawbacks to competitive analysis you should consider before moving forward with your report. While these drawbacks are minor, understanding them can make you an even better manager or business owner.  You don’t just want to gather the information from your competitive analysis—you also want to take action on that information. The data itself will only show you where you fit into the market landscape. The key to competitive analysis is using it to problem solve and improve your company’s strategic plan. Confirmation bias means interpreting information based on the beliefs you already hold. This is bad because it can cause you to hold on to false beliefs. To avoid bias, you should rely on all the data available to back up your decisions. In the example above, the business owner may believe they’re the best in the SEO dental market at social media. Because of this belief, when they do market research for social media, they may only collect enough information to confirm their own bias—even if their competitors are statistically better at social media. However, if they were to rely on all the data available, they could eliminate this bias. A competitive analysis report represents a snapshot of the market landscape as it currently stands. This report can help you gain enough information to make changes to your company, but you shouldn’t refer to the document again unless you update the information regularly. Market trends are always changing, and although it’s tedious to update your report, doing so will ensure you get accurate insight into your competitors at all times.  Learning your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses will make you a better marketer. If you don’t know the competition you’re up against, you can’t beat them. Using competitive analysis can boost your marketing strategy and allow you to capture your target audience faster. Competitive analysis must lead to action, which means following up on your findings with clear business goals and a strong business plan. Once you do your competitive analysis, you can use the templates below to put your plan into action. "
"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts",https://www.semrush.com/blog/competitive-analysis/,"Kelly Lyons TABLE OF CONTENTS A competitive analysis is the process of gathering data about the products, sales, and marketing strategies of your competitors (i.e., other businesses in the same industry). Businesses use that data to identify their strengths and weaknesses and discover potential opportunities.  A competitor analysis can help you understand the market landscape and make informed decisions to improve your position in the industry.  Depending on your business, you can analyze competitors in many ways. But we’ll cover the basic steps you need to know. Pro tip Generate a competitive analysis snapshot in a few clicks with Semrush’s Market Explorer. Get competitor data, like:  Competitive analyses are essential for any business that wants to succeed in a crowded and competitive market. Regularly conducting competitive analyses can help you: Read on to find out how you can get started. The factors you include in your competitor analysis depend largely on your goals and industry. For example, an online pet store owner will want to see what products their competitors sell that they don’t. A SaaS company, on the other hand, will probably want to look into their competitors’ features and pricing pages. To get you started, here are seven factors that stay the same across the board: Compare your features or products to your competitors’ and highlight those that make you stand out or fall behind. For example, if you’re selling an email marketing tool, you might want to compare features such as: That way, you get a clearer picture of what your competitors are doing differently and why. Pricing is the amount of money you charge for your product or service. Use your competitors’ pricing strategy to guide your own. And make sure you’re not over- or under-charging your customers.  Suppose you run an online course platform. You might want to compare pricing factors such as: Target audience is the group of people you’d like to reach and serve with your product or service. When conducting a competitive analysis in marketing, try to discern who your competitors are targeting.  How does it differ from your target audience? What are their needs, preferences, behaviors, and pain points? Are they targeting someone you aren’t? How can you better serve them? For example, if you run a fitness app, you might want to compare target audience characteristics such as: Marketing is the process of promoting and selling your product or service to your target audience.  Look at your competitors’ marketing strategies to identify how you can improve your own. And increase your awareness, visibility, and conversions. For example, if you own a travel booking website, you might want to compare marketing channels such as: Differentiators are the factors that make your product or service unique and superior. Identify what that means for you. Look at how your customers position themselves to find out what sets you apart. And how your product or service is better. Then, communicate those differentiators to your customers.  For example, if you sell a vegan meal delivery service, you might want to highlight differentiators such as: Strengths are the aspects of your product or service that give you an advantage over your competitors.  List and analyze your strengths in your competition analysis. So that you know what you can double down on. For example, if you run a cloud storage service, you might identify strengths such as: Weaknesses are the aspects of your product or service that put you at a disadvantage compared to your competitors.  List these out as well. Acknowledge them. Analyze how they affect your performance and results.  And then work on improving them. For example, if you are selling a video streaming platform, you might want identify weaknesses such as: Before you start this walkthrough, grab a copy of Semrush’s Competitive Analysis Template to follow along. Here’s what it looks like: Perform a competitor analysis with these seven steps. Tip Create a free Semrush account (no credit card needed) to follow along with the steps in this guide. First, build a list of key competitors to watch out for. This lets you see who might be competing for your audience’s attention. And gives you an idea of who to focus on throughout your competitor analysis. We’ll walk you through how to find your competitors in these four key areas: So that you can enter your data into your competitive analysis document. Like this: Your industry competitors sell similar products or services to yours. Focus primarily on direct competitors, though. Meaning brands that fill a similar gap within your niche. An example of direct competitors is Abercrombie & Fitch and Aritzia.  Both fashion brands focus on trendy women’s clothing—popular with Generation Z and younger millennials. They occupy the same position in the market. An indirect competitor would be Animal Crossing and Mortal Kombat. They’re both video games, but their audiences are vastly different. You should also consider your business’s size and competition level.  For example, a local Toyota dealership may rank for similar keywords as the overarching Toyota brand. This doesn’t mean they will directly compete.  The local dealership’s competition would be other local dealerships instead. Keep context in mind as you use competitor analysis tools. Here are a few ways to identify direct competitors: For a general view of your digital competitors in your industry, use a competitor analysis tool like Market Explorer. First, select “Find Competitors” and enter your domain.  This will automatically generate a list of the major players in your space. The “Overview” tab will show you who you compete with online. It will also visualize their relative market share, audience size, and growth rate. Now, scroll to the “Growth Quadrant” widget. The Growth Quadrant chart breaks down you and your competitors into four basic categories:  Note where each competitor stands. And how their audience and traffic growth compare to yours.  Which players occupy the same quadrant as you? Which should you be most concerned about? Once you’ve identified key competitors in your industry, research their online presence through organic, paid, and local searches. Next, identify your competitors in organic search. These are brands that target the same SEO keywords as you. These can differ from industry competitors. They may not have the same type of business you do. But they still compete with you in Google’s search results. You can easily find organic competitors with the “Competitors” report in Semrush’s Organic Research tool. Start by entering your domain and clicking “Search.” Then, click on the “Competitors” tab. You’ll see a list of organic competitors sorted by Competition Level.  This metric is based on the number of keywords a competitor ranks for. And the number of keywords you and the competitor share.  Like so: Note your biggest organic search competitors and any new names that did not appear in Market Explorer. Pro tip Head to the “Position Changes” tab to see the specific keywords your top organic competitors have been ranking for and monitor how their rankings shift over time to identify keyword opportunities.   Next, look for your paid search competitors. These are businesses that show up for the paid keywords you’re targeting. Ads that show up for users depend on many factors, including location, device, and context of the search term. A tool like Advertising Research can help you identify who your paid competitors are. And how their paid ads perform. To get started, enter your domain and hit “Search.” Next, head to the “Competitors” tab. Scroll and you’ll see a list of paid search competitors, sorted by competition level: You can also see how many paid keywords you have in common, how much paid traffic your competitors’ ads drive, and how many paid keywords your competitors rank for. If you run a business with a physical storefront, you must identify your local competitors—both online and offline. These are competitors who offer a similar product or service (filling the same market gap) within your geographic area.  To do that, track important local keywords and compare your business’s proximity with other sites that rank for those keywords. And you’ll want to make sure your website ranks prominently on Google for location-specific keywords.  That means optimizing your site for local SEO so you’ll appear in local search results.  Like so: You can start your competitor research by using the Keyword Overview tool. To see what the SERP (search engine results page) looks like for keywords like “pizza near me.” The top-ranking domains are your local SEO competitors. To then track important local keywords and competitors, use the Position Tracking tool. Enter your domain in the Position Tracking tool. And, click “Set up tracking.” Set a local target (e.g., the city or state where your company operates). On the next page, you can add the keywords you’d like to track and click “Add keywords to campaign.” Now, you’re ready to “Start Tracking.” Once your campaign is ready, visit the “Competitors Discovery” tab to find local competitors. You’ll get a list of competitors sorted by “Visibility.” Visibility is based on click-through rate (CTR) and shows a website’s progress in Google’s top 100 ranked webpages for keywords in the current tracking campaign. Take note of competitors who are dominating the local conversation.  Then, ensure your website is optimized for local search with up-to-date address and contact information across all your platforms (especially your Google Business Profile).  Further reading: Building a profile for each of your main competitors allows you to benchmark important details, including market share and audience demographics. Here’s what that’ll look like in your competitive analysis document: Let’s begin by analyzing market share, or the influence a brand has within their industry. Market share is a percentage of a company’s sales or revenue out of the total sales or revenue for its industry. Publicly traded companies are required to state their earnings every quarter.Many private companies are, too.  So, you can get a lot of information by searching “[company name] quarterly report” or “[company name] annual report” in Google. You can also consider estimations from trusted business publications. For example, Yahoo Finance reports on a lot of this information for public companies. Here’s some of the market share information for Apple: To calculate market share, divide the total company revenue by total industry sales. Like this: Here’s a real-world example:  Toyota sold 2,332,262 vehicles in the U.S. in 2021. And 15 million total vehicles were sold in the U.S. during the same period. If we divide Toyota’s total sales (2,332,262) by the industry’s total sales (15,000,000), we get 0.155. Multiply that by 100, and we get 15.5%. Which is Toyota’s market share for 2021. We recommend completing this step for your main direct competitors. It’ll help you benchmark your success within your industry. Market share shows you which competitor has the biggest influence over your audience. But it doesn’t tell you who that audience is.  Understanding audience demographics can help you connect with customers and create products and services that address their needs. You can use a tool like Market Explorer to analyze any website’s audience demographics.  Enter a competitor’s URL and head to the “Audience” tab. This report provides a high-level overview of the audience demographics in your niche, including: Next, find out how your audience compares to and overlaps with your closest competitors.  You can do this with Traffic Analytics. Select “Check Competitors.”  Then, enter your domain and up to four competitor domains into the search bar, and click “Analyze.”  Now, head to the “Audience Overview” tab.  You’ll see a side-by-side comparison of each domain’s audience. And how much they overlap.  It’s time to round out your competitor profiles by filling in basic company information.  This provides context that could help you analyze your findings. And build a more competitive marketing strategy. For example, one of your competitors may have only been around for a few years. But if they’ve raised millions in funding rounds, they may be a bigger threat to you than a larger, more established competitor. You can find basic information about your competitors in the “Company Info” section of the Traffic Analytics “Overview” report.  Just scroll down and you’ll see the widget.  You can see which categories your competitors operate in, their funding amount, and roughly how many employees they have. Further reading: How to Use Website Demographics to Improve Your Marketing Strategy Once you have all the preliminary insights, it’s time to explore “the four Ps” of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.  Let’s break it down: Add that information to your competitive analysis document so that you can access and analyze the data easier: Analyzing this information about your competitors will give you a deeper understanding of their marketing strategies. You can replicate what’s already working in a better way. And avoid making the same mistakes.  Begin by visiting each competitor’s site and asking yourself: Take notes on your findings. Your competitors’ websites will give you insights into which products they prioritize. And which products they heavily promote or prominently display in their navigational menus. Steve Madden, for example, heavily prioritizes women’s apparel and accessories.  They have several main navigation drop-downs for these topics: ”Women’s Shoes,” “Women’s Clothing,” “Handbags,” and “Accessories.” Like this: If we scroll further, we can also see that they are promoting what is probably a popular product right on the homepage: This is why manual investigation is important—you can get clear insights into what your competitor prioritizes just by navigating their site. Once you’ve identified popular products, pay attention to pricing. Here are some things to note in your competitor analysis: Of course, you need to make a profit. But if you notice that your competitors price similar products lower or constantly offer discounts, you may need to change your pricing strategy. The third P refers to where your product or service is available. This can be a physical storefront, an online store, or both. If you place your product somewhere—in person or online—where your target audience doesn’t shop, you probably won’t see great results. To start, here are a couple of questions to consider: Here’s an example of “place” in action: Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta is known for his famous clients and luxury makeup line.  So, it makes more sense that he sells his products in Sephora stores rather than affordable retail chains like Walmart or CVS. Place also applies to where you market your product. Say your company offers financial planning services. Your core audience probably skews a little older.  So, it wouldn’t make much sense to market your services on Snapchat, which has a notoriously young audience without as much buying power. Promotion is all about where your competitors market their products or services. This includes both advertising channels and brand messaging. Here are a couple of things to consider when researching your competitors’ promotion strategies: To get an idea of how your competitors generate their traffic, head to the “Benchmarking” report in Market Explorer.  You’ll see a breakdown of their traffic generation and social media distribution. And can compare up to five competitors at once.  Like this: Here are a few conclusions you may draw from competitors’ best-performing channels: One of the best ways to understand a competitor’s marketing efforts is to browse their website. It’s manual work, but it’s well worth the effort. Pay attention to any of the following elements: Take note of what your competitors are doing and what you aren’t. See what’s missing from your site and incorporate relevant missing elements into your own strategy.  You should also look into your competitors’ paid marketing strategies. And you can easily do that with a tool like Advertising Research.  Enter a competitor’s domain and click “Analyze.”  You’ll see a dashboard with a summary of their ad campaigns, including: Scroll down and you’ll get a list of keywords your competitor is bidding for in Google Ads.  Plus, you’ll see: Like so: If you want to dive a little deeper, click on the “Ads Copies” tab.  You’ll see the actual ad copy your competitor is running in Google Ads. And the keywords that trigger those ads.  Further reading: One of the most important aspects of competitive analysis is to understand how your competitors are reaching their target audience.  In other words, what marketing channels are they using? How effective are they? How can you leverage them for your own business? And these marketing channels can be divided into eight main categories: You can quickly analyze any competitor’s marketing channels with Market Explorer.  Just enter their URL and scroll down to the “Domain vs Market Dynamics” widget. Click on each marketing channel to examine it more closely. Like this: Try to see how your main competitors’ marketing channels compare to yours. And record that data in your competitive analysis document. And determine whether you need to make any changes to say or get ahead. Further reading: Effective Digital Marketing Channels & How to Use Them After completing your competitor analysis, turn your observations into actionable insights by performing a SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  A SWOT analysis looks like this—you’ll fill in each quadrant for your brand based on your competitive analysis findings: If you fill out a SWOT analysis for both your brand and your competitors, you can compare the answers to the above questions to see where each brand excels. This will help you identify where you’re doing well and where you can improve. Further reading: Once you have done your competitive analysis, you need to track and monitor results. This’ll help you measure your effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. There are different ways to do this, depending on your goals and metrics.  But one of the most efficient is to set up a monthly competitor report.  Head to My Reports, scroll through, and select “Monthly Competitor Analysis.” Enter your domain and two competitor domains. And click “Create report.” You’ll quickly get a competitor analysis report. First is a summary of your domain’s current performance.  Then, you’ll see how your domain compares to your competitors.  Like so:  The great thing about the report is that it’s interactive. You can edit, add, or remove any widget you want.  For example, if you want to add more competitors to “Traffic Analytics Overview,” hover over the widget and click the pencil icon. Add more competitors to the “Competitors” box, and click “Apply.”  Here: The widget will immediately display data for the competitors you added.  Once you’re done, click “Generate PDF report” on the top right.  In the pop-up, enable “Email report” and “Schedule report.”  Select your ideal time frame for the tool to run the report and email it to you. And click “Generate and send.”  Now you have an easy and effective way to track and monitor performance against competitors.  You should run a competitor analysis at least every quarter. And ideally every month.  Why?  Because digital marketing is always changing. And you need to stay on top of what your competitors are doing.  However, you may also want to do a competitor analysis even more frequently.  Especially if you notice any significant events or trends that affect your industry.  For example, you may want to do an ad-hoc competitor analysis if you’re: Whatever frequency you choose, make sure to set a clear schedule and stick to it.  Doing a competitor analysis can help you stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive edge in your market. You’ve learned how to conduct a competitive analysis and why it’s important for your business. But don’t stop there.  The market is constantly changing, and so are your competitors. You need to keep an eye on their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. You can do that with Market Explorer. It can help you: And more.  Get a comprehensive overview of your competitive landscape and stay ahead of the game. Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Free Keyword Research Tool"
"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.techtarget.com/searchCustomerExperience/feature/Marketing-trends-to-watch-for,"Getty Images/iStockphoto The constantly evolving marketing landscape requires successful marketers to keep abreast of emerging trends. Understanding and adapting to these trends -- driven by the often-clashing forces of technological advancements, consumer behaviors, market dynamics and global events -- is essential for marketers to maintain a competitive edge in today's fast-paced, digital-centric world. By paying close attention to and learning from these trends, astute marketers gain valuable insights into their consumers' evolving needs, preferences and behavior patterns. Better still, they provide their companies with more effective, targeted and personalized marketing strategies. To unlock new avenues of growth, marketers must experiment with new tools and technologies, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalized marketing, as well as employing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for immersive customer experiences. Here's a look at key market trends in 2024, their central role in driving innovation and growth, and how these trends, if properly understood and harnessed, make brands more resilient within their unique marketplaces and against an ever-growing competitive landscape. AI and ML are poised to significantly influence marketing trends this year and beyond because they streamline and personalize consumer experiences. In 2023, the Sprout Social Index found that 81% of marketers say AI has had a positive impact on their work and that it also helps in creative areas such as content planning and productivity. AI and ML automate some repetitive tasks, freeing marketers to focus on strategy and creative initiatives. Moreover, these technologies analyze vast amounts of data to glean insights for a more targeted, efficient marketing strategy adaptable to changing consumer behavior patterns. AI and ML also excel at personalizing the customer journey by tailoring ads and product recommendations, as well as predicting future consumer behavior. In this instance, AI algorithms process a customer's past behavior, social media interactions and other data to forecast their future actions, allowing companies to cater proactively to their preferences. Finally, AI and ML contribute to more effective customer segmentation. Instead of relying on broad demographic information, these technologies partition customers based on nuanced behavioral patterns and preferences. This allows brands to create highly tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer groups. As the adoption of smart speakers and voice-activated devices continues to rise, the shift to voice search optimization is expected to continue, underpinned by consumer preference for hands-free, voice-activated technology. Additionally, with advancements in natural language processing and AI, voice search technology delivers more accurate and personalized responses, which contribute to a positive user experience. The increased prevalence of voice search also brings about a significant change to the search engine optimization (SEO) landscape. Traditional keyword strategies require reevaluation as voice searches typically involve more conversational and long-tail phrases. Moreover, the ""position zero"" or featured snippet on search engine results pages becomes even more desirable since voice assistants often pull their responses from these highlights. Hence, marketers need to adapt their SEO strategies to ensure their content is voice search-friendly and capable of earning that coveted spot. Furthermore, voice commerce represents a promising frontier for businesses. As consumers become more comfortable using voice commands to complete a range of tasks, the leap to voice-activated purchasing is natural. Brands that optimize their content for voice search are better positioned to tap into this emerging market, driving sales and enhancing customer convenience. The increase in the use of chatbots, including both AI-powered and rules-based versions, is a compelling trend for several reasons. First, chatbots offer companies a cost-efficient, round-the-clock customer service solution. They can handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, providing immediate responses and improving customer satisfaction levels. AI-powered chatbots learn from every interaction, enabling them to deliver increasingly personalized responses over time and enhance user engagement.Second, chatbots are highly versatile marketing tools, used not only for customer service but also for product recommendations, appointment scheduling and lead qualification. This versatility becomes increasingly valuable as businesses seek to maximize their online engagement. Additionally, rules-based chatbots provide a consistent, reliable service that's adaptable to a brand's specific requirements, making them a preferable option for companies that deal with straightforward customer queries. Third, along with increasing customer engagement and potential revenue for businesses, chatbots save company resources -- both time and dollars. Brands that engage in personalized marketing create a bond with their audience, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Unlike generic marketing, personalized marketing speaks directly to the customer, addressing that individual's unique needs and preferences. This shift to building trusting relationships and providing a better customer experience promises increased conversions, customer retention and, ultimately, revenue growth. Additionally, with advancements in AI and ML technologies, the possibilities for personalization are expanding. Brands can analyze customer behaviors and preferences in real time, allowing them to finetune marketing efforts to each customer. This leads to more effective and efficient marketing strategies, as resources are concentrated on the most impactful channels and methods, ultimately improving return on investment (ROI). The ubiquity of internet connectivity and the ever-increasing power of modern smartphones have made video content more accessible than ever before. Consumers can now stream high-quality video on the go, making it a powerful tool to catch their attention and deliver impactful messages. Moreover, platforms such as TikTok, as well as features like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts have popularized short-form video content, driving brands to adopt this format to reach and engage their audience. In addition, video content offers a unique blend of audiovisual elements that allows marketers to tell more engaging and persuasive stories, helping their products and services stand out in a saturated market. Video content can seamlessly incorporate customer testimonials, product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes insights and many other elements that build trust and cultivate a deeper connection with the audience or even encourage purchases. Lastly, video marketing impacts key metrics such as SEO, conversion and click-through rates. Research shows that incorporating videos into marketing emails can boost click-through rates, while embedding videos on landing pages can increase conversion rates. Indeed, successful video marketing in 2024 aligns with the data-driven approach that modern marketing strategies strive to adopt. By enabling direct purchases within the same social media apps where consumers connect, share and inspire each other, social commerce platforms are transforming the shopping journey into a seamless, convenient experience. With features ranging from shoppable posts to in-app stores, brands have the opportunity to target and convert consumers within a familiar social context, effectively shortening the path to purchase. Moreover, social commerce leverages the power of user-generated content and peer-to-peer influence, key elements in today's consumer decision-making process. Consumers can see how products look in real life, read reviews and even make inquiries to brands through direct messages, all in one platform. This immersive, interactive shopping experience, coupled with the ability to instantly share and discuss products with friends and followers, amplifies word-of-mouth marketing and encourages impulsive buying behaviors. As such, social commerce is expected to keep its momentum in the marketing landscape and can be used in conjunction with a marketing team's growing omnichannel customer experiences. This marketing trend establishes an authentic connection with audiences that traditional advertising struggles to achieve. Influencers have a strong rapport with their followers, which makes their promotional content more engaging, relatable, impactful and trustworthy. The intersection of influencer marketing, video content, and social commerce creates a potent combination for brands. As consumers continue to shop directly from social media platforms, influencers tap into this trend by creating engaging video content showcasing products, encouraging their followers to click through and make a purchase. This seamless integration of shopping and social media amplifies the efficacy of influencer marketing and underlines its importance in a company's marketing strategies. The continued adoption of sustainable and ethical marketing reflects a growing consumer consciousness around environmental impact and social issues. As people become increasingly informed and concerned about the biosphere, the ethical and sustainability practices of a business come into sharp focus for discerning would-be consumers. It's an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves, align with consumer values and forge stronger connections with their customer base. In addition, companies adopting sustainable and ethical marketing practices gain a competitive advantage. Research shows that consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact. As such, sustainable and ethical marketing is not just a trend, but a strategic approach likely to drive consumer behavior and loyalty. VR and AR technology will be adopted by more businesses in 2024, transforming how companies interact with their customers, especially as it becomes more accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses. These immersive technologies offer an entirely new level of engagement, allowing consumers to experience products or services in a simulated environment before purchase. This not only enhances the customer's understanding of the product, but it also creates a memorable, engaging experience that increases brand loyalty. In addition, AR and VR provide marketers with innovative ways to tell their brand stories. For instance, AR can overlay digital information on physical products or locations, providing an interactive experience. Meanwhile, VR can transport users to entirely new environments -- a virtual showroom or exotic location tied to a brand's narrative -- and even show how furniture or other large fixtures would fit in a specific room. These technologies change the dynamics of customer engagement and experience. Marketers realize that comprehensive, accurate data can provide invaluable insights into customer behavior, preferences and trends.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/12/07/the-7-biggest-consumer-technology-trends-in-2022/,"Technology like artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) is re-shaping industry and augmenting the abilities of professionals, including doctors, lawyers, and architects, enabling them to do amazing new things. However, it’s also enriching our everyday lives by improving our ability to communicate with friends and family, improve our health, fill our homes with smart appliances and gadgets, or simply just letting us kick back and enjoy movies, music, and gaming in more impressive and experiential ways. The 7 Biggest Consumer Technology Trends In 2022 Consumer technology is a broad category of products and services that cater to helping us solve problems or just have better experiences in our day-to-day lives. It can be big and bold, in the manner that only a 100-inch 8K tv set can be, or sleek and portable, like the latest generation of phones, watches, and media players. So here’s an overview of a few of the ways that Apple, Samsung, Sony, and the other market leaders will be looking to part us from our hard-earned cash in 2022. Rise of the Domestic Robots  Robots in the home have been on the cards for a while, and robotic vacuum cleaners and other single-purpose devices are already relatively common. But with Astra, Amazon is bringing what it believes will be the first general-purpose home robot to the market. If it’s a success, other manufacturers are sure to follow, in the same way, they did when Amazon introduced home AI assistants with the Echo. Astra can act as a roving security bot, keeping an eye out for people who shouldn’t be there, as well as an ""Alexa on wheels,"" coming to find you when you have calls or alerts. It also has a personality so it can keep you company or just provide general entertainment. Other robots that are either hitting the market or appearing as prototypes will offer help with household chores, healthcare monitoring for the elderly who live alone, or serve an educational purpose.   Smarter Things The first generation of ""smart"" products were really just ""connected products,"" from smartphones that let us browse the web to TVs that let us watch Youtube and Netflix. Machine learning came later, and as well as enabling phones to prolong their battery life with intelligent power management, or take better pictures with image enhancing algorithms, brought us smart thermostats that learn how to operate efficiently and devices that are essentially capable of operating autonomously, like self-driving cars. Today, rather than simply letting us watch online content and run apps, smart TVs use AI to adapt their picture and sound to the environment they are in, and have built-in natural language recognition algorithms so we can control them with our voices. Smart consumer devices in 2022 will build on this ability to deliver personalized solutions to the unique challenges we face in our day-to-day lives, whether it’s the angle that the sun shines on our TV screen or monitoring our activity to provide fitness advice. VR/AR and the Internet of Senses Engage with digital content and services online traditionally involves stimulation of two of our senses – sight and hearing. Moving forward, both manufacturers and content providers will look to engage us through touch, taste, and smell to create truly immersive consumer experiences. Much of this will take place in virtual reality environments (VR), where new devices will let us smell and feel experiences, meaning that they will seem increasingly “real” and interactive. Videogame Phasmophobia involves hunting ghosts, with the terrifying innovation that players can feel themselves being touched or grabbed by ghouls and apparitions, if they are wearing a haptic suit. Both VR and augmented reality (AR) consumer devices will proliferate during 2022 – Oculus is reported to have sold close to two million of its Quest 2 headsets during 2021, meaning more content producers will be motivated to bring their games and experiences to VR. We can also expect competitors like HTC and Sony to step up their play for their share of the lucrative new market. We can also expect consumer entertainment, including movies and gaming, to provide more realistic audio experiences – Nvidia is applying the “ray tracing” principles it uses to create ultra-realistic computer images to sound creation, to create richer and more realistic soundscapes. Enter the Metaverse A new Matrix movie will drive consumer interest in virtual worlds and alternate digital realities, and consumer technology will be there to offer a taste in 2022. Companies including Facebook, Nvidia, and Microsoft have laid out their plans for the metaverse, with their aim of creating immersive online environments that offer a persistent world for work, socializing, and play. However, game developer Epic could have played the biggest part in showing us the way forward, with its Fortnite game attracting up to 15 million players online at any one time, to build things, experience live concerts, and, of course, blow each other up.   5G and other ultrafast networks 5G capabilities will become the norm for mobile phones and other devices at all price points, rather than being confined to premium and flagship products. This will mean higher definition and higher bandwidth video services will start to become available, including 8K streaming as well as cloud gaming and VR. This means that devices will become smaller and lighter as there’s no need for bulky processors and graphics chips, with all the calculations being done remotely and the output simply streamed to consumer devices as a video feed. Smart homes and the internet of things The trend for all things domestic to become increasingly “smart” and capable of communicating and connecting with each other in more useful ways will continue throughout the next year. In fact, analysts at Gartner have predicted that the average home could contain more than 500 smart devices during 2022. This year should finally see the launch of Matter, the “smart home OS” created in collaboration by Apple, Google, and Amazon, which aims to create a standard operating environment for connected devices in the home. Currently, devices from different manufacturers generally operate using their own protocols, and although these are frequently designed to play nicely with others, there’s no equivalent of Windows or MacOS to let consumers manage and connect all of their gadgets and toys. This could change in 2022, when it’s predicted the market for smart home devices will grow to $53 billion. NFT, blockchain, and digital twins I’m putting these all together in one category because when it comes to their applications in consumer technology, they are closely related. Put simply, blockchains (persistent, distributed, and encrypted digital ledgers), NFTs (unique tokens that can be created and stored on blockchains), and digital twins (digital models or replicas of real-world products or processes) will change the way we interact with technology. In 2022 we will start to see them impacting consumer products in a big way. Consumer brands including Sony, Asics, and Coca-Cola have signaled their intention to be a part of the NFT space, and we can expect to see digital goods and services designed to complement and augment physical consumer products. This is a result of brands increasingly seeing growing their digital engagement to be equally important to their business strategy as simply selling us products.  Read more about these and other future trends in my book, Business Trends in Practice: The 25+ Trends That are Redefining Organizations. "
"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-world-of-ands-consumers-set-the-tone,"Leading consumer-facing businesses place a lot of emphasis on listening to consumers, as they should. Consumer sentiment and behavior can be fast changing, confusing, and sometimes contradictory. Today’s consumers, for instance, are both trading down and selectively splurging. They’re buying big, established brands and exploring newer, smaller ones. Many of their buying decisions are a matter of “and,” not “or.” Staying attuned to these trends in consumer behavior can be difficult for companies, but doing so is absolutely critical—even (or perhaps especially) when the ands seem paradoxical. Quick decision making on how to meet consumers’ expectations in this world of ands must be at the top of a company’s agenda. In addition, businesses must prioritize a series of ands themselves to grow profitably and outperform competitors. This article outlines the ands that we see playing out in consumer behavior, along with the ands that business leaders need to act on. Many of the insights I’ll be sharing with you are powered by ConsumerWise, McKinsey’s proprietary solution that tracks and analyzes both consumer sentiment (what consumers say and how they feel) and consumer spending (what they actually do)—thus providing a 360-degree view of today’s consumers. ConsumerWise currently spans ten markets; by the end of 2023 it will expand to 20 markets, covering 90 percent of global GDP. Our latest ConsumerWise research reveals that consumers are engaging in the following four ands. It also reveals that trade-offs are false choices. Consumers are both flocking to value and buying premium products and services. Worldwide, approximately two in three consumers are trading down by buying cheaper brands or private-label products. In Europe, 84 percent of consumers perceive branded products as having similar quality to private labels. In China, consumers are becoming more value conscious and aggressively seeking discounts and promotions. At the same time, 44 percent of consumers around the world (and 60 percent of Gen Zers and millennials) say that they plan to splurge, particularly on purchases that are experiential or provide immediate gratification—think restaurants or travel. Regionally, intent to splurge closely aligns with economic optimism: 77 percent of Indian consumers plan to splurge, compared with only 26 percent of Japanese consumers. In short, consumer spending is falling globally, and midpriced goods and services are most at risk. Shoppers who splurge in some categories may seek value in others, which means companies must develop a detailed and nuanced understanding of trends and segments. The majority of consumers now use at least three channels for each purchase journey. And while 75 percent of consumers want a seamless omnichannel experience, only 25 percent are satisfied with the experience that retailers provide. Omnichannel excellence is especially important given that omnichannel consumers are at least 1.25 times more valuable than their single-channel counterparts. Consumers are also increasingly adopting new shopping channels. More than 60 percent of US and Asian consumers plan to continue using channels that they first tried during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as grocery delivery or social commerce. Traditionally, big brands have dominated the consumer landscape, especially during times of uncertainty. In the US market, big brands grew 50 percent at the height of the pandemic. But consumers are also trying new brands: one in three consumers did so in the past three months. Gen Zers and millennials are especially susceptible to brand switching, as they are five times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands are better or more innovative than established brands. In general, consumers are now purchasing a repertoire of products to fill specific needs, instead of purchasing just one product. To illustrate: whereas ten years ago a typical household would have had just one type of milk in the fridge, a household today might buy cow’s milk, high-protein milk, and a plant-based alternative such as almond milk or oat milk—each for a unique occasion. Consumers are gravitating toward sustainable products: 84 percent say that sustainability is a very important factor in their purchase decisions. However, 50 percent say they’re not sure whether they would pay a premium for sustainable products in times of inflation. Still, products making sustainability-related claims are growing faster than products that make no such claims. Companies face the challenge of striking a balance between sustainability and price, which is especially critical in an inflationary environment. In addition to keeping their finger on the pulse of the ever-more-demanding consumer, businesses should respond to these trends with their own ands. Companies need to be uncompromising in the following three areas. Approximately 60 percent of top-performing CEOs are concerned about an economic downturn. Even amid the highest global inflation since the 1970s, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and volatile commodity prices, investors continue to expect profitable growth above the historical average. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, CEOs have a unique opportunity to make distinctive decisions that lift their companies above competitors. Fortune favors the bold, and pursuing growth must be a conscious, strategic choice. Companies are more likely to outperform peers when they pursue multiple pathways to growth, including expanding into new categories and new geographies. Changing global demographics, in particular, are unlocking new growth opportunities. Consider that Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, and that GDP for both China and India continues to climb in global rankings. Companies that successfully expand into new geographies are 22 percent more likely to achieve above-market, accretive growth. Companies that wish to keep up must speed up—and scale up. The pandemic created a greater chasm between retail leaders and laggards: more than 90 percent of growth in retail market cap was driven by 25 large, tech-forward retailers. We expect further market consolidation, accelerated by the end of cheap capital. But scale must not come at the expense of personalization. The bigger your company, the better you should get at localizing and personalizing your offerings. More than 70 percent of consumers expect personalization and are frustrated when companies don’t deliver it. Companies that excel at personalization generate 40 percent more revenue from those activities than average players. Historically, more than 80 percent of consumer companies’ growth has come from core offerings. Clearly, nurturing the core isn’t optional—and we’ve found, in fact, that many companies underestimate the core’s growth potential. But as consumer behaviors diverge, companies must seek to become indispensable in consumers’ lives by expanding beyond products and into a range of services. Companies would do well to start pursuing “share of life,” not just share of wallet. Traditional sector barriers are falling; McKinsey research suggests that one-third of global GDP will soon come from ecosystems (which are networks or partnerships that cut across different industries). And consumers are receptive: for example, 60 percent of European consumers say they’re willing to buy services from retailers they trust. Companies can also tap into B2B opportunities—an excellent example being the rise of retail media networks, which generate a significant amount of incremental revenue and operating margins as well as generating valuable new consumer insights. Consumers today live in a world of ands—they’re much more demanding and less willing to make trade-offs. Businesses, too, should live in a world of ands. If they take an uncompromising stance on the three aforementioned imperatives, the payoff will be above-average growth and healthy margins.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/consumer-behavior-trends,"MASTER OF COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT ONLINE November 15, 2023 View all blog posts under Articles  As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow in both use and popularity, its impact on the consumer continues to change the marketplace. In 2022, people are starting to look for more commerce-related balance, establishing an equilibrium between technology and human interactions in their buying decisions. At the same time, people are expressing an increased desire for convenience in their shopping choices. They are more comfortable receiving recommendations on new products or services from social media influencers. All these dynamics create an interesting quandary for retailers and other brands who must learn to market to buyers with these new desires. In light of this shift, brands and those who study business and marketing must find new ways to connect with customers. While technology is still an important element, people are starting to shift toward wanting a balance between convenience and human interactions. As you work toward earning a communication degree online, understanding the consumer business trends that impact consumers and their buying decisions will be helpful. So, how has the customer changed in 2022? As you consider marketing to the current demographic, keep in mind that in 2022: Technology, personal perception, environmentalism and convenience are prime movers for 2022’s consumers. Keep these trends in mind when developing a marketing and communications strategy. Today’s consumer is interested in both remote and in-person shopping experiences. It’s a trend prominent enough to spawn new words designed to describe this convergence from both the consumer's and company’s perspective. The first term coined as a result of this trend is the word: “phygital.”  It refers to the merged brick-and-mortar experience and the online shopping experience. Another term to emerge is: “omnichannel,” which describes a company’s approach to providing customers with a consistent experience regardless of how they shop, whether in person, online or on a mobile device. All brands must understand what consumers define as beautiful, as it will impact everything from the selection of models for advertisements to the products people choose to buy. The definition of beauty is changing as consumers push for diversity and inclusivity. Many shoppers respond positively to ads that include people with disabilities, people of different body sizes and people with a diverse set of physical features. On the other hand, consumers are responding negatively and rejecting brands that push a specific “traditional” definition of beauty. Beauty is now seen as a way to express one’s self, rather than a way to fit into a mold. Brands that respond to this consumer behavior trend by embracing diversity in both their products and their advertising choices will see greater success as 2022 progresses. Social influencers are growing in importance among brands and marketing professionals. A recommendation from a well-loved blogger or radio personality can drive more sales than a strategically positioned advertisement. Reviews from real consumers will influence more buying decisions than just about anything else. Influencers are valuable in changing consumer actions because of the many different platforms they use for their messages. From online platforms to Instagram, to other social media channels, to radio and television advertising, influential people can leverage multiple channels to drive purchase decisions. Brands that incorporate this knowledge into their marketing plans will find greater success in the coming years. Environmental awareness is not a new trend, but in 2022 it continues to become increasingly important to consumers. A report by IBM revealed that 49% of consumers over 12 months paid an average of 59% more for products that labeled themselves as socially responsible or sustainable. Additionally, 51% of those surveyed noted environmental sustainability is more important now than it was a year ago. Meeting these eco-responsible goals can take on many forms, from using recycled packaging to phasing out single-use plastic products. While this trend does not necessarily mean a company has to adopt a fully sustainable approach, it does mean ignoring the impact that sustainability can have on the bottom line doesn’t make good business sense. Convenience matters to the consumer in 2022. Nothing exemplifies this like the popularity of delivery on-demand services. This concept makes it possible for the consumer to receive a product or service at a specific location at a moment’s notice. For consumers, this eliminates the inconvenience of going to a physical location to pick something up. Delivery on demand is most commonly associated with restaurant food delivery services such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, but the category encompasses a wide range of services. Dry cleaning, massages and even childcare services can be obtained through on-demand services. The way a brand communicates its value to its target market is essential to its success. Marketing and communication professionals must understand consumer behavior trends to better serve their clients. When you as a communication professional can capture the ethos and essence of today’s consumers, you are better able to draft communications that highlight brand value, framing it in light of the consumer’s unique desires. Marketing professionals who adapt to trends early can gain an advantage over those who lag behind. The USC online masters in Management offers a robust curriculum. Courses focus on a variety of topics covering consumer behaviors that teach students to identify and adapt to changes in consumer preferences as they unfold. Learn how USC can help you identify and leverage the consumer trends that keep businesses relevant.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing,"Anyone who has hosted a game night over video chat or ordered groceries to be delivered at home for the first time understands how profoundly the COVID-19 crisis has changed our behavior as consumers. But which of these changes will stick? We see several that are key: We’ve boiled down extensive McKinsey consumer research into ten exhibits to illustrate the trends and the consumer segments associated with each. Physical distancing and stay-at-home orders have forced whole consumer segments to shop differently. A few months into COVID-19, consumer shopping online has increased significantly across many categories. Consumer intent to shop online continues to increase, especially in essentials and home-entertainment categories. More interestingly, these habits seem like they’re going to stick as US consumers report an intent to shop online even after the COVID-19 crisis. Categories where expected growth in online shoppers exceeds 35 percent include essentials such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, groceries, household supplies, and personal-care products. Even discretionary categories such as skin care and makeup, apparel, and jewelry and accessories show expected customer growth of more than 15 percent. While the shift to online shopping has been near universal across categories, high-income earners and millennials are leading the way in shifting spend online across both essential and nonessential items. Gen X has experienced a similar online shift, although not at the same scale as millennials. Gen Z has concentrated its shift online in particular categories: apparel and footwear, at-home entertainment, and food takeout/delivery. The crisis has prompted a surge of new activities, with an astonishing 75 percent of US consumers trying a new shopping behavior in response to economic pressures, store closings, and changing priorities. This general change in behavior has also been reflected in a shattering of brand loyalties, with 36 percent of consumers trying a new product brand and 25 percent incorporating a new private-label brand. Of consumers who have tried different brands, 73 percent intend to continue to incorporate the new brands into their routine. Gen Z and high earners are most prone to switching brands. The beneficiaries of this shift include big, trusted brands, which are seeing 50 percent growth during the crisis, and private labels, which have outpaced the retail market. Some 80 percent of customers who started using a private brand during the pandemic indicate they intend to continue using it once the COVID-19 crisis subsides. Shoppers have cited a number of reasons for switching brands, with availability (in-store and online), convenience, and value leading the pack. For marketers, this highlights the need to quickly become aware of when shoppers are migrating brands or retailers and then to manage the logistics to ensure product and service availability. Looking at China, which is further along in its recovery cycle than most countries, the increase in promotional activity to cater to consumers’ focus on value in apparel is expected to continue. As Americans contemplate going back out to shop, hygiene and hygiene transparency have emerged as important sources of concern. It is becoming increasingly important for stores and restaurants to not only follow hygiene protocols (thorough cleaning and masks for consumers and employees are top priorities) but also communicate effectively that they are following those procedures. US consumers have already started to change their behavior in response to hygiene concerns. Technologies that enhance hygiene, particularly contactless activities such as food and grocery delivery and curbside pickup, are taking off. There is strong intent to continue contactless activities across the United States. As an example, 79 percent of consumers intend to continue or increase their usage of self-checkout in retail after COVID-19. Millennials and Gen Z are the widest adopters of contactless activities. Around 40 percent of US consumers have reduced spending in general, and they expect to continue to cut back on nonessentials specifically. This reality reflects profound discomfort about the state of the economy. With overall consumer spending declining, intent to spend in essential categories is increasing. Even among those with higher incomes, we see that while essentials show spending momentum, intent to buy discretionary products still lags significantly. As the worst of the crisis abates, we do see online spending in nonessential categories such as apparel and footwear starting to come back. This effect is strongest among high-income earners, consumers in the Northeast, and Gen Z. Tied to the concern about the state of the economy is an increasing consumer focus on value—especially for essential categories. For example, in shampoo on Amazon, value and mass products have experienced the greatest increase in share, at two- and five-percentage-points gains, respectively. Premium shampoo products have seen significantly less growth in comparison, losing more than five points of volume. Americans are spending more of their at-home time on domestic activities, media, and news. Intent to eat more at home post-COVID-19 has strengthened significantly over the past three months. Usage of popular online entertainment platforms has skyrocketed. (The popular video game Fortnite recently hosted a concert that was “attended” by 12.3 million users.1Andrew Webster, “More than 12 million people attended Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert,” The Verge, April 23, 2020, theverge.com.) Investment in at-home fitness through equipment purchases and online activity is growing. Consumers still expect to spend more time on at-home activities, even in less-restricted regions. As economies reopen, 73 percent of consumers are still hesitant to resume regular activities outside the home. They are concerned about going to a hair salon, gym, or restaurant, but are especially worried about shared environments, such as public transportation, ride sharing, air travel, and being in crowded spaces, such as attending large indoor or outdoor events. US consumer-segment behavior varies significantly across the next-normal trends. We have identified five customer segments driven by optimism, health, and financial concerns, each of relatively similar size. These five segments exhibit the consumer trends to a different degree and have the following characteristics: Affluent and unaffected: These consumers express general optimism about the future (~20 percent higher than the overall US consumer population), skew male (60 percent), and make more than $100,000 a year. They tend to be able to stay at home during the pandemic crisis, allowing them to shop more online. This group is slightly less price sensitive than other cohorts due to greater job stability. Uprooted and underemployed: These consumers are feeling major impact on both their finances and health due to job insecurity. They are cautious about how they spend money, with low optimism about future economic conditions. Not surprisingly, this group is trading down to essentials and value, swapping out brands, and shopping online when possible. Financially secure but anxious: This population is largely 65 years old and older and is generally pessimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19, which has had a major impact on their habits. This group has expressed the greatest need for hygiene transparency, with above-average concerns on safety and well-being and concerns about the ability to get necessary supplies. Out trying to make ends meet: These consumers are being cautious about how they spend money and feel that their jobs and job security have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. This group has significant representation from minority groups and rural populations. They are less likely to be able to stay at home (hence their lower likelihood to be part of the homebody economy), but they are strongly moving toward shopping for essentials and value. Disconnected and retired: This category denotes those who are retired, over 65, and have a lower income level than the financially-secure-but-anxious segment. They are broadly optimistic about economic conditions after COVID-19 and are less likely to display any of the next-normal characteristics. Predominantly from Southern and suburban areas of the country, this group has not exhibited significant changes in shopping behavior. As retailers contemplate the changes in consumer behavior, they will need to adjust their strategies and execution to adapt to the new norms, including: Further, it will be important for brands to reevaluate and reprioritize their target audience and consumer segments, as the emphasis on each of the next-normal trends will vary based on the target consumer.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/03/15/15-customer-behavior-trends-emerging-this-year/,"﻿As the business world evolves, so do consumer habits and tastes. Customer behavior is the most vital component to crafting a great marketing campaign. However, customers are only human, and their behavior can be erratic and unpredictable. What might look like a great marketing approach in a meeting room can therefore be far less effective in practice. Knowing the trends in consumer behavior before they become apparent can give a business an unprecedented advantage over its competitors. What major customer behavior trends are expected to emerge this year? Fifteen members of Forbes Business Council share their insights below and discuss some of the trends expected to feature most prominently. Members of Forbes Business Council share trends they see coming in customer behavior in 2021. 1. Increased Demand For Transparency There is an increasing customer demand around transparency. Big corporations have abused the trust of the customer for a long time. We've seen many scandals within various industries from food to automotive. That's the reason why the customers of today require transparency on the supply chain, ingredients, processes and so on. - Baris Kavakli, Portera BV 2. Accelerated Online Buying Customers will accelerate buying online and using home delivery. This was already happening, but the pandemic revealed to skeptics that it’s easy, it works and it makes their life easier. All businesses will need to have an online strategy or they’re going to get beaten by their competitors that embrace and execute an online sale and marketing strategy. - Brandon White, File Finder 3. Increased Focus On What's Truly Important I think that Covid has taught us all how to better value and prioritize what's important in our lives. This will change the products and services we decide to purchase, the types of products and services we buy and how we actually affect that purchase. I think we'll see more sophisticated casual clothing that can be used professionally in Zoom calls, as well as worn outside.  - Harris Kaplan, Red Team Associates 4. A Shift In Omnipresent Communication There will be a definite shift in omnipresent communication. As organizations move online and remotely, creating a cohesive brand experience is not only desired but also expected. Customers are looking for an experience that meets them where they are, when it's convenient. AI and robust customer service will lead the charge across all platforms. - Cody Jefferson, Embrace The Lion 5. A Greater Human Element In Client Interactions Customers will expect a greater “human” element in their interactions. Virtual meetings and the absence of gatherings has people eager for real-time, meaningful conversations. To a Zoom-fatigued population, a phone call can seem more personal and relaxed. Now is the time to reacclimate to personal phone calls or even mutually-acceptable live visit. - Robin Day, NIH Research & Consulting, LLC 6. B2B Customers Gaining More Leverage Business-to-business customers will continue to have more and more leverage with tech vendors from checking authentic reviews to managing the sales cycle on their timeline and even benefiting from group buying pricing. Buying is changing for B2B and it's a blessing. I encourage customers to have more leverage and power as it will result in a better relationship, less buyer remorse and higher retention. - Gil Allouche, Metadata.io 7. Increased Demand For Anonymity Customers will demand more anonymity. Given continued data breaches combined with recent politicization of electronic and social media footprints of private citizens, a new trend will emerge where assurances of security will no longer suffice. Companies will need to accommodate customers who will simply refuse to provide any information beyond what is needed for a particular transaction. - Edward Dellheim, Point B Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify? 8. Consumers Looking For Social Experiences Once the vaccine reaches the masses and the weather breaks, we are going to see a wave of consumers wanting to go out and shop. Beyond making purchases, consumers are going to want an experience and to socialize. The demand for interaction with others will never be higher and there will be an opportunity for brands to capitalize on this consumer behavior that we hope to see in the near future. - Rob Almond, NEST 9. More People Taking A DIY Approach We expect to see more people leaning toward trying to do more things themselves instead of looking for others to do them. This can include more cooking at home, less dining out, more attempts at doing one's own nails or styling one's own hair, fewer salon visits, more at-home workouts and less gym time. I think businesses need to be prepared to provide customers with products and services that will help aid them during this DIY period! - Hoda Mahmoodzadegan, Molly’s Milk Truck 10. Growing Importance Of Content Marketing As conferences and trade shows put their events on hold in 2021, more businesses will search for alternative ways to sell their products and services. Content marketing is going to play a larger role in this transition and I'm not talking about ads. Businesses will turn to the media to try to introduce their products to consumers and enterprise. The successful ones will find ways to sell online. - Mark Macias, MACIAS PR 11. Increased Focus On Green Products Clean energy has already been a trend but this year it will grow exponentially because we've evidently seen the damage we have brought to the planet. As consumers demand more green products, suppliers will produce more, pushing the demand further. Demand for electric vehicles, solar panels and vegan meat will be higher than ever, and more and more companies will pivot toward this.  - Sardor Akhmedov, Jafton.com 12. More Socially Conscious Shopping Higher degrees of socially conscious shopping is a behavioral trend to watch for in 2021. Love it or hate it, cancel culture as a phenomenon is not new to the world of commerce. However, with tensions high, customers will heavily consider the political, social and ethical ramifications of supporting businesses or brands that are not aligned with their philosophies and beliefs. - Jay Johnson, Coeus Creative Group 13. Increased Value-Based Spending Increased value-based spending (e.g., purchasing locally and buying from brands that align with personal values) is a trend to watch. Before buying from your brand, customers will continue wanting to see brands be a leader for change within different industries and communities and take action on the social issues they care about. - Sindhu Kutty, Kuroshio Consulting 14. A Boom In Customer Automated Decisions 2021 will see a boom in customer automated decisions in both the business-to-consumer and the business-to-business markets. Customers have learned that they can set their software to make decisions based on preferences and trends. It can be something as simple as reordering office paper, or something more critical like letting your digital marketing software make autonomous daily decisions on a million dollars in ad revenue. - Matthew Tranguch, PMG 15. Customers Preferring Vetted Vendors Customers are going to be more cautious in how they join with vendors for a number of reasons. With continued data breaches, more customers will want to make sure they are working with vetted vendors. This will also be done for quality—with a slowdown in all industries, customers will be looking for better quality and standards instead of rushing in for the lowest costs. - Mark Ceely, BECK Strategies Inc.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/understanding-and-shaping-consumer-behavior-in-the-next-normal,"Months after the novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States, the COVID-19 crisis continues to upend Americans’ lives and livelihoods. The pandemic has disrupted nearly every routine in day-to-day life. The extent and duration of mandated lockdowns and business closures have forced people to give up even some of their most deeply ingrained habits—whether spending an hour at the gym after dropping the kids off at school, going to a coffee shop for a midday break, or enjoying Saturday night at the movies. This article, a collaboration between McKinsey and the Yale Center for Customer Insights, was written by Tamara Charm, Ravi Dhar, Stacey Haas, Jennie Liu, Nathan Novemsky, and Warren Teichner. Such disruptions in daily experiences present a rare moment. In ordinary times, consumers tend to stick stubbornly to their habits, resulting in very slow adoption (if any) of beneficial innovations that require behavior change. Now, the COVID-19 crisis has caused consumers everywhere to change their behaviors—rapidly and in large numbers. In the United States, for example, 75 percent of consumers have tried a new store, brand, or different way of shopping during the pandemic. Even though the impetus for that behavior change may be specific to the pandemic and transient, consumer companies would do well to find ways to meet consumers where they are today and satisfy their needs in the postcrisis period. Behavioral science tells us that identifying consumers’ new beliefs, habits, and “peak moments” is central to driving behavioral change. Five actions can help companies influence consumer behavior for the longer term: According to behavioral science, the set of beliefs that a consumer holds about the world is a key influencer of consumer behavior. Beliefs are psychological—so deeply rooted that they prevent consumers from logically evaluating alternatives and thus perpetuate existing habits and routines. Companies that attempt to motivate behavioral change by ignoring or challenging consumers’ beliefs are fighting an uphill battle. The COVID-19 crisis, however, has forced many consumers to change their behaviors, and their new experiences have caused them to change their beliefs about a wide range of everyday activities, from grocery shopping to exercising to socializing. When consumers are surprised and delighted by new experiences, even long-held beliefs can change, making consumers more willing to repeat the behavior, even when the trigger (in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic) is no longer present. In other words, this is a unique moment in time during which companies can reinforce and shape behavioral shifts to position their products and brands better for the next normal. When consumers are surprised and delighted by new experiences, even long-held beliefs can change, making consumers more willing to repeat the behavior. For example, approximately 15 percent of US consumers tried grocery delivery for the first time during the COVID-19 crisis. Among those first timers, more than 80 percent say they were satisfied with the ease and safety of the experience; 70 percent even found it enjoyable. And 40 percent intend to continue getting their groceries delivered after the crisis, suggesting that they’ve jettisoned any previously held beliefs about grocery delivery being unreliable or inconvenient; instead, they’ve been surprised and delighted by the benefits of delivery. Another example of changing beliefs involves at-home exercise. The US online fitness market has seen approximately 50 percent growth in its consumer base since February 2020; the market for digital home-exercise machines has grown by 20 percent. It’s likely that many people who tried those fitness activities for the first time during the pandemic believed that at-home exercise couldn’t meet their exercise needs. That belief has clearly changed for many of these consumers: 55 percent who tried online fitness programs and 65 percent who tried digital exercise machines say they will continue to use them, even after fitness centers and gyms reopen. To reinforce the new belief that online fitness can be motivating and enjoyable, NordicTrack, in a recent TV ad titled “Face Off,” shows that online workouts can foster the same friendly competition and connection that people look for when they go to the gym or attend in-person exercise classes. An effective way to reinforce a new belief is to focus on peak moments—specific parts of the consumer decision journey that have disproportionate impact and that consumers tend to remember most. Peak moments often include first-time experiences with a product or service, touchpoints at the end of a consumer journey (such as the checkout process in a store), and other moments of intense consumer reaction. Some companies have focused on enhancing the consumer’s first-time experience. Plant-based-meat manufacturer Beyond Meat, for instance, was already benefiting from delays in meat production in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis: its sales more than doubled between the first and second quarters of 2020. In collaboration with local restaurants and catering companies, the company has been delivering free, professionally prepared food to hospitals and other community centers. By giving away Beyond Burgers prepared by professional chefs, Beyond Meat is creating positive first experiences with its product at a time when consumers are more open to trial. As the consumer journey has changed, so have the peak moments, and it’s crucial for companies to identify and optimize them. For example, a peak moment in a grocery store might be the discovery of an exciting new product on the shelf. In the online-grocery journey, however, a peak moment might instead be on-time delivery or the “unboxing” of the order (the experience of taking the delivered items out of the packaging). Grocers could consider including a handwritten thank-you note or some other surprise, such as a free sample, to reinforce consumers’ positive connections with the experience. Highly emotional occasions can spark intense consumer reactions and therefore present an opportunity for companies to create peak moments associated with their products or brands. For example, when graduations shifted from formal, large-scale ceremonies to at-home, family celebrations, Krispy Kreme offered each 2020 graduate a dozen specially decorated doughnuts for free. With that promotion, the company connected its brand with an emotional event that may not have been a key occasion for doughnuts prior to the pandemic. Companies can nudge consumers toward new habits through product innovation. For instance, the COVID-19 crisis has spurred consumers to become more health oriented and increase their intake of vitamins and minerals. Unilever reported a sales spike in beverages that contain zinc and vitamin C, such as Lipton Immune Support tea. The company is therefore rolling out such products globally. It’s also aligning its innovation priorities with consumers’ emerging health-and-wellness concerns. Similarly, packaged-food companies can encourage the habit of cooking at home. Spice manufacturer McCormick’s sales in China have sustained double-digit increases compared with 2019, even as the Chinese economy has reopened and people go back to their workplaces. The same pattern could play out in other countries. Kraft Heinz’s innovation agenda for its international markets now prioritizes products that make home cooking pleasurable, fast, and easy—products such as sauces, dressings, and side dishes. These will be targeted at “light” and “medium” users of Kraft Heinz products. Habits can form when a consumer begins to associate a certain behavior with a particular context; eventually, that behavior can become automatic. To help turn behaviors into habits, companies should identify the contextual cues that drive the behaviors. A contextual cue can be a particular task, time of day, or object placement. For example, more consumers are keeping hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes near entryways for easy access and as a reminder to keep hands and surfaces clean. Product packaging and marketing that reinforces the put-it-by-the-door behavior can help consumers sustain the habit. Some companies may need to identify—and create—new contextual cues. Before the COVID-19 crisis, a contextual cue for chewing-gum consumption was anticipation of a social interaction—for instance, before going to a club, while commuting to work, and after smoking. As social occasions have waned during the pandemic, a chewing-gum manufacturer must look for new contextual cues, focusing largely on solo or small-group activities, such as gaming and crafting. Gum manufacturers could consider designing packaging, flavors, and communications that reinforce those new associations. People across the country have felt an intensified mix of anxiety, anger, and fear because of recent events, making marketing a tricky terrain to navigate. The heightened emotions and increased polarization of the past few months could drive lasting changes in consumers’ behavior and shape their long-term preferences. Companies should therefore ensure that all their brand communications are attuned to consumer sentiment. The quality of a company’s communication and its ability to strike the right tone will increasingly become a competitive advantage. McKinsey’s consumer-sentiment surveys show that consumers are paying closer attention to how companies treat their employees during this crisis—and taking note of companies that demonstrate care and concern for people. That has implications for how brands connect with consumers and what types of messages will resonate. Hair-care brand Olaplex, for example, became one of the most mentioned hair-care brands on social media when it started an affiliate program: the company donated a portion of its proceeds from product sales to customers’ local hairstylists, helping them stay afloat during salon closures. That said, consumers will see through—and reject—messages and actions that are performative and that seek to commercialize social issues. A brand’s communications must align with its purpose; otherwise, the messages won’t ring true. Testing marketing messages among a diverse group of consumers, in the context in which those messages will appear, could help prevent costly missteps. Consumer beliefs, habits, occasions, and emotional-need states will continue to evolve rapidly over the next year or two as the world awaits a COVID-19 vaccine. For consumer companies to stay abreast of those changes, monitoring product sales alone won’t be sufficient. Companies must also conduct primary consumer-insights work, with a focus on identifying changed behaviors and associated changed beliefs and motivators to get a comprehensive picture of the changing consumer decision journey. Qualitative, exploratory research will have a particular role to play as a precursor to (and, in some cases, a substitute for) quantitative research. Digital data-gathering and monitoring techniques—such as mobile diaries, social-media “listening,” and artificial-intelligence-driven message boards—will be vital tools to help companies understand emerging behaviors and contextual cues. When structured well, those insights generate new thinking within an organization that can be validated through larger-scale surveys and in-market testing. Companies can then refine their product offerings and marketing messages accordingly. In addition, granular analyses of footfall data and omnichannel sales will unearth telling details, such as which geographic regions are seeing in-person commerce rebound first and which products consumers are buying (such as smaller pack sizes to avoid sharing, activewear versus office wear, and so on). Whereas in the past, companies might have fielded high-level usage and attitude surveys and brand trackers a few times a year, it’s especially important now for companies to keep a closer eye on the evolution of consumer behavior on a weekly or monthly basis. The COVID-19 crisis has changed people’s routines at unprecedented speed—and some of those changes will outlast the pandemic. Even in states and cities that have reopened, consumers remain cautious about resuming all of their precrisis activities. We’ve seen differences in consumer behavior across geographic markets and demographic groups, and those differences will only widen during the recovery phase, given that the health, economic, and social impact of COVID-19 isn’t uniform. Companies that develop a nuanced understanding of the changed beliefs, peak moments, and habits of their target consumer bases—and adjust their product offerings, customer experiences, and marketing communications accordingly—will be best positioned to thrive in the next normal.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2022/11/03/how-will-consumer-behavior-change-in-2023/,"Understanding consumer behavior is elemental to brand and business strategy, and 2023 will be a whopper of a year for those challenged with fathoming the consumer mind. Unlike previous years, 2023 will be a jumble of mixed signals, reflecting a unique environment characterized by opposing forces: exuberance as the pandemic wanes, tempered by caution in the face of economic turbulence. In a nutshell, don’t expect consumers to be shy about spending in 2023. But expect them to be far pickier — seeking out fewer, richer experiences that blend the digital fluidity of the pandemic with the familiarity and intimacy of the times that came before. Here are some of our predictions that describe how consumer behavior will shake out next year. Despite Economic Gloom, Spending Will Increase According to Forrester’s July 2022 Consumer Energy Index And Retail Pulse Survey, the majority of online adults in the US (64%), the UK (59%), and France (55%) are anxious about the possibility of a recession. Consumers have banked significant savings during the pandemic, however, and household cash flow will grow by the second half of the year. While consumers will still signal caution, money in the bank will spur them on to greater spending. Consumers Will Gravitate Toward Blended Experiences The pandemic forced consumers to experiment with new ways of living, shopping, and interacting. Post-pandemic behavior will see a regression to old habits but in a way that optimizes the experience. Moviegoers will rush back to theaters to see the next “Avatar” while ordering their popcorn with QR codes. In 2023, consumers will blend newly gained digital fluidity with old-fashioned familiarity. Less Will Be More, And Quality Will Trump Quantity Consumers will reconcile their fiscal caution with their spending impulse by being highly selective about which brands and experiences to patronize. The goal: Squeeze maximum value out of each outlay (for example, consumers have become much pickier about which streaming subscription to keep). In 2023, consumers will continuously curate experiences, selecting those that deliver high value while abandoning those that do not.

Updated:                       January 17, 2024        Published:                       April 03, 2023        Your marketing strategy can't stay stagnant if the people you're selling to are changing their behavior — you have to adapt and learn how to cater to them. Marketers should look for observable differences in buyer behavior to continue meeting their needs. To help marketers and other business professionals make more data-informed decisions, we've conducted a bi-annual survey of 600+ U.S. consumers to better understand how adults spend their money. Using HubSpot Blog Research from our Consumer Trends Report, we'll explore the nature of the biggest consumer behavior changes between May 2022 and January 2023 so that you can keep up. In May 2022, only 12% of consumers preferred purchasing products through social media apps like Instagram Shop or Facebook Marketplace. In the past three months, 41% of social media users have shared that they feel comfortable purchasing on social media platforms. That behavior shift is astounding. More than ever, social media marketers are more likely to impact consumer behavior by sharing content that builds interest and trust through these channels.  HubSpot Blog Research also found that the most popular social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, are the most preferred platforms for social shopping. Social shoppers also say Instagram and Facebook have the best in-app shopping experience. These apps have very easy-to-use shopping interfaces, and it's plain to see why they can sell or influence users. When consumers watch or interact with the content they enjoy and receive ads relevant to their interests, the products seem more valuable to their hobbies and lifestyles. 29% of Gen X (up 16% from May 2022) and 16% of Boomers (up 60%) say social media is their preferred product discovery channel. This shift is huge for generations that typically claim to prefer learning about products through TV ads and internet search.  Social media usage isn't just something teens use every day. Older generations use it just as often. Social networking provides entertainment, community, and a more dedicated space for window shopping. 42% of consumers have chosen a product based on it being made by a small business in the last three months, up 8% from May 2022.  The later effects of the pandemic may be behind this behavior shift. Many consumers saw some of their favorite mom-and-pop shops close due to lost funds from decreased traffic and customers. Now that the worst of COVID is over, many consumers haven't forgotten to support smaller businesses. Another reason for supporting small businesses is the shopping experience itself. Many consumers enjoy shopping small due to: Along with support for the local community, consumers are giving more of their money to companies that take a political stand on issues they care about. These three causes are among the most important to them: Consumers want to support a company that pays it forward. They want to impact the world around them as they become more informed on news of global political unrest and other issues. Businesses have much to gain from implementing socially responsible initiatives, programs, or donations to attract and retain customers. It may be the leading decision factor behind your next customer's purchase between you and your competitor. One of the most significant risks a marketing team can make is failing to adapt to changing consumer behavior shifts. Stay informed on your customers' behaviors and ensure you meet their needs — even as they change.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results   CANOO INC.    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels.

Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Third Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.   CANOO INC.   ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION TABLE (in thousands)   The following table reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended  December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net loss $            (80,231) $         (138,112) $         (487,694) $         (346,768) Interest expense (income) (60) (24) 2,249 (103) Depreciation 2,534 2,604 11,554 8,921 EBITDA (77,757) (135,532) (473,891) (337,950) Adjustments: Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability (3,175) (3,280) (26,044) (104,446) Loss on fair value change in private placement warrants liability — — — 1,639 Loss on extinguishment of debt 531 — 4,626 — Other (expense) income, net (358) (64) 62 (224) Stock-based compensation 18,593 18,602 79,573 108,360 SEC settlement (Note 12) 1,500 — 1,500 — Non-cash legal settlement (Note 12) — — 5,532 — Adjusted EBITDA (60,666) (120,274) (408,642) (332,621)    Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

""The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that's a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners."" Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Third Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:  See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

After giving effect to the issuance and sale of the second and third Yorkville convertible debentures for a total of $53.2 million, and proceeds from the August PIPE of $3 million, our cash balance would have been $61.2 million on June 30, 2023. GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $70.9 million and $161.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $164.4 million and $289.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA of $(62.3) million and $(129.4) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $(149.8) million and $(267.3) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

Second Half 2023 Business Outlook Based upon our current projections, Canoo expects: Adjusted EBITDA: $(120) million to $(140) million Capital Expenditures of: $70 million to $100 million   See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.   Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, August 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.  Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.
